[trooper 1] If there
was a schedule,
if they simply rotated the roster,
that would make it so much easier.
- [trooper 2] Exactly.
- [trooper 1] Who's gonna
be out in front of that?
Pick the wrong day to raise your
hand and they'll reassign...
- Niya.
- [Niya] Yes.
How's it look?
It's good. It's prepped for
a test flight in the morning.
The password tonight is Kafrene.
Kafrene.
- Got the key?
- [inhales sharply]
We have to wait for my supervisor
to leave. He never stays late.
Are we safe here?
You're a new test pilot.
You've just arrived,
you're excited.
You wanted to look around
before you went to bed.
- We started flirting...
- I like that. [chuckles]
[gasps]
Sorry. [stutters] I was
told not to look at you.
- I didn't see anything.
- Hey, it's okay. It's okay.
I'm so nervous.
[sighs] Nervous is good.
Keeps us awake.
It's gonna be fine.
I'm never coming back here.
It's a big sacrifice.
I... I've had fun here.
That must sound strange.
- No, not at all.
- [breath trembling]
Now everything changes.
- You're very brave.
- Am I?
- My hand's shaking.
- [footsteps approaching]
Hey.
There you are.
Who is this?
[Niya] New pilot. He couldn't
sleep. We were just talking.
Hello, pilot.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Welcome aboard.
[whispers indistinctly]
[Niya chuckles softly]
What was that?
She said you were cute.
Have you been part of
this for very long?
[gasps]
I shouldn't ask. I'm sorry.
You're risking everything.
You can ask what you want.
[sighs]
If I die tonight,
was it worth it?
You've done this before. You
must have thought about it.
This makes it worth it.
This. Right now.
Being with you. Being here at the
moment you step into the circle.
Look at me.
You made this decision long
ago. The Empire cannot win.
You'll never feel right unless you're
doing what you can to stop them.
[softly] You're coming
home to yourself.
You've become more
than your fear.
Let that protect you.
Thank you.
Okay.
- I need a 12-minute head start.
- Is that enough?
I'll see you along the road.

You're okay. You're okay.
You're fine.
We're safe.
Hey, Bix. Right
here, look at me.
It's Talia.
- What happened?
- [B2EMO] She had an-another dream.
Go back to bed. She'll be fine.
[B2EMO] C-Cassian
will want to know.
- [Brasso] She'll deal with that.
- He'll be home t-tomorrow.
We'll talk about
this in the morning.

[Peer Maid] Really?
Are we allowed?
[Leida] Not if you
don't do what I say.
Quiet. And no

And stop.
- You can look now.
- [girl gasping]
- [Peer Maid 2] Oh, Leida!
- [girls exclaiming]
[Sordo] <i>Took a wedding to
get her out of the house!</i>
- Here comes the party.
- [Sordo] Perrin! My favorite nephew.
Sordo, my favorite reprobate.
- How are you?
- Mon.
Praise Mothma. What a
glorious turn of events.
So good to see you.
And looking younger
every season.
- How effortlessly you lie.
- [chuckles]
And my dear boy...
I feel you lurking, Erskin.
Governor Klavin has a new ship.
We have limited space
on the docking platform.
They've taken two spots and
don't seem eager to move.
- And you've asked them nicely?
- I've tried.
What's all this?
More parking problems.
The Governor's ego apparently
won't fit into our lot.
Is this about his new ship?
He's your friend, darling.
You and Erskin sort it out.
[Sordo] So, what do
you think, Perrin?
Wait for them here or get
a head start on the bar?
[Perrin] I think
the bar, don't you?
[♪ soft dramatic music playing]
[man 1] Greetings, Senator.
Senator Mothma.
Have you seen who's here?
[man 2] Congratulations.
- [Mon] Morning.
- [man 3] Senator.
- [Mon] Senator Beeva.
- Senator.
So good to see you.
There you are.
- [Mon] Tay!
- How's the bride-to-be?
Very spoiled at the moment.
- If not now, when, right?
- I suppose.
We're having lunch on the
terrace. You'll see for yourself.
Uh, Mon. Mon, I was hoping
for a chance to speak.
I'm afraid I'm a bit
of a blur right now.
But I know you left
word. I saw your message.
It's just... Well, it's, uh,
quite the production. [chuckles]
Is there something urgent?
No.
Just... looking to catch up.
- I'll find you later.
- Oh, something to look forward to.
[Luthen laughs] Ah. Beautiful.
Thank you. That's the last one.
- [Mon] Luthen.
- Oh, dear, you found me.
[Mon] What are you doing here?
I'm afraid that's a secret.
Away! Away! No chatting, Luthen.
- No spoiling.
- [Luthen chuckles]
- Away with you.
- [Mon] What's going on here?
You'll ruin my surprise.
You've told her nothing, I hope.
Well, I only just arrived.
Oh, he's terrible
at keeping secrets.
- Oh, I've been practicing.
- We'll see about that.
You'll see when I'm ready.
Now, surely there's something
that desperately requires
your presence elsewhere.
- Very well.
- [chuckles]
But I will get it out of him.
What's he doing here?
He's with Sculdun.
- For what?
- Apparently, it's a secret.
[Luthen] Cassian?
The team at Sienar
confirmed he got away clean.
That's it?
It was a pulse code.
Not a conversation.
We should've heard
from him by now.
I can't transmit
from here, Luthen.
I told you when we landed.
That's off the table.
There's already a crowd
at the docking platform.
We're naked here. There's
nowhere to hide a signal.
Keep listening.
[♪ serene music playing]
{\an8}[insects chittering]
[Bix grunts]
Ugh.
- Let me try the thick one.
- [Wilmon] You know it's not gonna last.
Well, it'll get them
through the harvest.
I can make a new part
tonight. Reforge the old pin.
- Thirsty?
- What?
- You better pull it together.
- Can you just be normal?
She seems awfully determined.
Please.
It's a long walk from the silos.
That's 'cause her mother
doesn't like me coming around.
Why?
We're toolies.
[Bix] There's all
kinds of people here.
Yeah, with shares and visas.
Well, they all
started somewhere.
It's not that easy.
Doesn't seem to be
stopping Talia and Brasso.
Please.
Just give it a rest.
[machine whining]
Hello, Beela.
Hi. [panting]
You've been out here so
long. I brought water.
What a lovely surprise. Wil was
just telling me how thirsty he is.
[chuckles]
What is it?
[Beela] I'm not sure.
[Wilmon] It's Imperial.
Have you seen 'em before?
Maybe once when I was little.
My father will know.
Well, it's not as
cold as it was.
I can't believe you
came all the way out.
Yes, you can.
[♪ tense music playing]

Porko!
Porko!
[Gerdis] You can
stop right there!
You got 15 blasters
pointed at you right now!
[Bardi] Don't tell him that!
[Gerdis] He's surrounded!
- He needs to know it.
- [Bardi] The number?
- The actual number?
- [Gerdis] Are you kidding?
- [Bardi] You are talking to the enemy!
- [Gerdis] I knew you would do this!
I'm not an Imperial pilot!
[Gerdis] Yeah, and I'm not
gonna put a bolt through you!
[Bardi] Toss the blaster
and get on the ground!
[♪ suspenseful music playing]
{\an8}[Krennic] No notes.
{\an8}No records.
None of you were here.
Nobody puts this
in their calendar.
All service and transport droids
will be data-wiped once we're done.
Your colleagues? Superiors?
If they're not in this room,
they're not cleared
for the project.
Colonel Yularen, Governor
Tarkin, all senior commanders
will be notified by the Emperor
at the time of his choosing.
Now, the group in this
room is, of this moment,
the tightest of closed circles.
Any security violation...
will be brought to the
Emperor's personal attention.

[Traditional Ghorman
Valley horn sounding]
[narrator on video] <i>Chances are,
if you've heard that sound before,</i>
<i>you've been to the Great
Valleys of Ghorman.</i>
<i>But it's a sure thing no matter
where you are in the galaxy,</i>
<i>you've had your eye on
something made of Ghorman twill.</i>
<i>Elegance and durability available
in all weights and weaves,</i>
<i>the Ghorman marque of
excellence is known everywhere</i>
<i>as the standard of
luxury and quality.</i>
<i>But where does this magic begin?</i>
[horn blows]
<i>That's the traditional
Ghorman Valley Horn</i>
<i>sounding the wake-up call for the
creatures who've made this planet</i>
<i>the success it is today.</i>
<i>Time to rise and start spinning.</i>
<i>Meet the Ghorman spider.</i>
<i>The experts have a fancier
word. Don't they always?</i>
<i>They call them "Ghorlectipods."</i>
<i>Whatever you call them, there's no
denying their dedicated work habits.</i>
<i>Spinning from dawn till dusk,</i>
<i>never stopping to feed or sleep
until the Ghorman sun has set.</i>
<i>Forty billion Ghorlectipods housed
in webberies across the planet</i>
<i>will spin the fiber from which
60 million bolts of Ghorman twill</i>
<i>will be processed just
this season alone.</i>
<i>It's a planetary-wide effort,</i>
<i>with each of Ghorman's nine
provinces pulling together</i>
<i>to provide a single processing
and delivery system.</i>
<i>All that gorgeous material
gathered for display and sale</i>
<i>in the capital city, Palmo.</i>
<i>The perfect setting for buyers and
designers from around the galaxy</i>
<i>to tour the showrooms
and brokerages</i>
<i>of this peaceful and
elegant metropolis.</i>
<i>"Ghorman pride" is a
term you'll often hear.</i>
<i>And it will only take you
a few hours on the ground</i>
<i>- to understand the source of that term.</i>
- [Krennic] Thank you.
Ghorman...
is of great interest
to the Empire.
[Cassian] What happened
to my ship? It's ruined.
[Bardi] Hold him. Get his feet.
- [Cassian] Where's Porko?
- [Gerdis] Shut up.
[Cassian] Somebody tell
me what's going on here.
- [Gerdis] Somebody hit him.
- [grunting]
- Who are you?
- Who is he?
- He's an Impy pilot.
- Can I just do this, please?
Then do it.
- Who are...
- Let's see. We're waiting.
- [Gerdis] Let me know when you're done.
- I'm here to meet a friend. Where is he?
- We ask the questions.
- Wow.
Big move. Now you can
ask him who he is.
Maybe I'll get an answer.
That's a stolen ship.
There was another pilot here,
waiting to take it forward.
Stolen for who?
- For the Rebellion.
- Whose rebellion?
Where is the pilot
I'm supposed to meet?
- Where is he?
- Your friend was not friendly.
He took a shot at us.
Tried to make a run for it.
Big mistake.
[Rika] He's lying anyway.
- This guy is a test pilot.
- [all groan]
[Krennic] I doubt anyone here is
unaware of the difficulties we've had
making the Emperor's dream of
energy independence a reality.
Now, I hear the rumors.
I know the stories.
Delays. Setbacks.
Groveling for Senate funding.
I met with the
Emperor yesterday.
And he suggested, I remind
you that the Energy Initiative
remains the centerpiece
of his agenda.
Access to stable,
unlimited power
will transform the
galactic economy
and solidify Imperial authority.
And it turns out,
spiders are not the most
unique thing in Ghorman.
There's a mineral
underground. Doctor?
Deep substrate foliated Kalkite.
[Krennic] Kalkite.
Synthetic Kalkite.
Kalkite alternatives.
Kalkite substitutes.
I mean, the amount of time spent
pondering this grubby little bit of rock
is sadly astonishing.
Now, we've promised
delivery in three years.
That delivery is dependent on
some version of Ghorman Kalkite
to coat the reactor lenses.
Now...
should we fail to
find any alternatives,
we will have to control Ghorman
with a hand firm enough...
[whispers] ...to silence... [in
normal voice] ...any resistance,
and you've been selected
to help plan for
that possibility.
[Rika] There are lights on but there
is no power. I don't understand.
[Bardi] This should
not be that difficult.
- [Rika] Where is the power coming from?
- [flicking switch]
[Bardi] Maybe on that side.
- [Rika] Bardi.
- [Bardi] Right.
- Please...
- [Bardi] Will you be able to do it?
Nothing's where
it's supposed to be.
[Cassian] I wouldn't touch that.
- [Bardi] What is it?
- I'm not sure.
What is that?
No clue.
So, how did you get here?
I guess it's my
lucky day. [scoffs]
You think this is funny?
Listen. There is
no manual. Okay?
Hey, we're trying to focus here.
What do you think?
Can you fly it?
[woman] I don't know.
[sighs] It's all new.
[Gerdis] He can fly it.
We need all the room we can get.
Do the math. We don't all fit.
Is there anything
to eat in there?
- [Bardi] No!
- [woman] No!
The Kalkite extraction. I'm
assuming it's an invasive process.
It would present stark challenges
to the local population.
Meaning what?
The extent of our withdrawal
may render the planet unstable.
It's gouge mining.
There would be stress
on the planet's core.
There is a risk
of... total collapse.
[Admiral Daysar] Nine cities.
Eight-hundred thousand Ghormans.
[Krennic] Well,
relocation would be ideal.
But we need to plan
for alternatives,
all of which will
require preparation.
[Partagaz] Ghorman is neither
obscure nor without political power.
They will not go quietly.
Which is exactly
why you're here.
[Bardi] If Rika says
she can fly it, she can.
She's not saying that. I...
I don't hear you saying that.
- It's confusing.
- He's gotta teach her.
Why would he do that?
If he doesn't, we'll kill him.
- [Gerdis] That's your plan?
- [Bardi] He's gotta know we mean business.
You'd never make it.
Alone? No. No way.
[Bardi] We're in charge.
We call the shots.
But the two of us, we could
be out of here by now.
[Gerdis] Having Rika kill us
- on take-off is not a plan.
- [scoffs]
[Bardi] She just
needs some basics.
He can't teach her if he's dead.
Everything with you is negative.
[Gerdis] Like killing
the only pilot we have?
Well, we gotta have one of 'em.
She just needs a little time.
- [Plug] How long will it take?
- And where do we go?
So, what is it?
- [Rika] Well, we can't stay here.
- Do they really trust you?
Or they just think
you're stupid?
You know I don't need
an excuse to hit you.
I get it.
Two days, no food.
Makes everyone cranky, right?
How do you know how
long we've been here?
- Hmm?
- [scoffs]
You were not here three
days ago when I left.
- We still have the same problem.
- [Flek] He's right.
- Who goes and who stays?
- We make trips.
- And who goes first?
- There it is.
Right there. There's
our real problem.
- Me?
- The lack of trust.
Your brother dumped us here and ran
away, and you wanna talk about trust?
- He went back for survivors.
- Nobody believes that.
Rika, Neek, Nazy, Rowd...
- Oh, we know what really happened.
- [Cassian] Maya Pei.
You're the Maya Pei Brigade.
What? What did you tell him?
- This is on you.
- Crab?
- What's the rub? He can see we're stuck.
- [chuckling] I know Maya.
- Maya's dead.
- According to you.
- Only he saw her.
- I was trying to save her.
We got ambushed. We lost
6 ships, 40 fighters.
- My brother was the only who...
- Your brother ran away!
- How do you know Maya?
- She was a customer.
We've been supplying
you along the way.
[pants] Argue all you want, but
we're all part of the same rebellion.
Your friend was hostile.
He was on a mission. [scoffs]
We're stealing an
Imperial test ship.
- For who? Who are you with?
- [pants]
I'm not telling you that.
We told you.
Yeah, well, you should
be more careful.
You scobbing jack pad!
- No, no, no!
- No. No. No.
- Hey, stop!
- Stop it!
Crab, you gotta stop it!
We're not here to... to
gloss over any difficulties.
The suppression of Ghorman is not
a decision to be taken lightly.
This is not our first
meeting on the subject.
Dee Shambo, Nisus Osar
will be our partners from the
Ministry of Enlightenment.
- Gentlemen...
- Thank you, Director. [clears throat]
Some of what you're thinking about
Ghormans at this very moment exists
because we put it there.
Hasn't there always been something
slightly arrogant about the Ghor?
Oh, we all feel
it. What is that?
Last year, when the shipping
lanes had to be shut down,
how hard would it have been to
simply allow the Imperial inspections
that most other planets welcome?
And didn't it seem as if the Ghor
were doing what they always do?
Putting themselves first.
Did a dedicated
Imperial Naval Inspector
really have to die to
protect Ghorman pride?
We did that.
We made the story. We
shaped it. We blew it up.
We decided when it was over.
With the right ideas
planted in the right market,
in the right sequence,
we can now weaponize
this galactic opinion.
[Osar] Now, we love the spiders.
Oh. Oh, it's an image
we can build on.
Aggressive, unpleasant,
keeping to themselves.
Now, is it just coincidence
that the Ghorman personality
seems so in tune
with these creatures?
The secrecy, the overcharging,
mocking Imperial protocols.
- Laughing at us...
- Okay.
Yep. We, uh... We get the idea.
[clicks tongue] You're
wasting daylight.
There must be food and
water out there somewhere.
- There's beasts out there.
- No talking.
I don't take orders from Bardi.
What kind of beasts?
You'll hear 'em tonight.
[chuckles softly]
- [Gerdis] I'm not saying I trust him.
- Supposed to be an intake gauge.
- But you'd let him fly us.
- If that's the only choice.
Once we're in the
air, he's in control.
- Why are there two?
- You're not getting anywhere.
You're not letting her concentrate!
Rika has to learn how to fly this plane.
Well, she's not...
So, who's really in charge here?
[all scream]
[animals screeching]
It's harder than it looks.
[Gerdis] Are you insane?
Why not have a plague? Or
stage some natural disaster?
That'd motivate them to leave
the place of their own accord.
We've actually gamed that out.
It gets unpredictable
very quickly.
The drilling equipment's
being assembled now
and warehoused for
transport when needed.
And once that's all ready,
how quickly can you mobilize?
- Once we're tucked away...
- Mmm.
...the drilling is easy. We can be
up and running in a matter of weeks.
[breathes deeply]
It's the administration and
security issues that are troubling.
We don't have a large presence
on Ghorman at the moment.
He's planned for that.
We're building a
new armory in Palmo.
Excuse me?
We're starting tomorrow.
You're awfully
quiet, aren't you?
- It's a lot to take in.
- [Krennic inhales] Oh!
I heard you learn quickly.
I like to know what
I'm talking about.
You're here at my request.
I don't get to Coruscant
much these days,
but I do keep my
ear to the ground.
Now, some people might not have
recovered from an incident like Ferrix.
You're not inspired by the
anti-Ghorman whispering campaign?
I'm still forming an opinion.
Piece of advice.
You think you're hard to read?
You need to get over that.
Now you have a plan already. You had
it before they finished speaking.
I want your assessment.
- [sighs]
- Propaganda will only get you so far.
You need a radical
insurgency you can count on.
Count on for what?
You need Ghorman rebels you can
depend on to do the wrong thing...
Director.
[♪ solemn music playing]
[B2EMO stuttering]
I was waiting.
And here I am.
Not for you.
Cassian.
[sighs] He'll be back soon.
[B2EMO whines]
I spoke to Kellen. He said they
haven't done this in years.
I've been here for eight.
I've never seen it.
What are they doing?
An Imperial Supply Census.
It's an audit. A spot check.
They wanna know what they've
got, where it's coming from.
- What about who's doing it?
- [Brasso] He's asking.
I guess right now, they're
focused on Council Five Hundred.
That's what we saw
out there today.
If they're checking
visas, we have a problem.
- He knows that.
- It's gonna be fine.
No one here is about to
let anything happen to you.
We'll know more tomorrow.
Nothing from Cassian?
I'll have a listen.
[radio static]
[Talia] Come here you.
Cassian?
- Nothing from Porko?
- [sighs]
I've been down there
scrubbing frequencies all day.
We know Cassian got off Sienar.
We know Porko was waiting.
What are we looking at?
I'm looking for a drink.
The monitor's on.
Hope for the best.
[♪ upbeat music playing]
[indistinct conversation]
He came last week.
- Jodi. Done.
- All right.
Leida won't be easy.
You'd know best.
Is he tough enough?
Not by half. He'll
either learn or be led.
[scoffs]
Well, I wish him luck.
Well, it's a proud
tradition in our family.
Uh, we've all treasured
our Naval service.
And where are you stationed?
I've been training on Steergard,
but we're all being transferred now.
Really? Where's everyone going?
Mmm.
[scoffs]
- Quite the event.
- Hmm.
Pace yourself. There's
two more days to go.
I always wondered
where you came from.
More reason to
doubt me, I'm sure.
That's hardly fair.
What are you doing here?
Sculdun's a client. We brought
a gift for the betrothed.
I'm working.
Are we pretending we just met?
No, you've been by the shop.
Just two single women
surveying the prospects.
[sighs]
You've been avoiding me.
You can't be serious.
- [chuckles]
- [chuckles]
- I'm overly sensitive.
- Huh.
It's been a rough few days.
Is everything all right?
I've had some business go sour.
Things have gone to a head.
I'm sorry.
I'm hoping to stay the
weekend, but... we'll see.
Is Marni joining you?
We're living apart
at the moment.
I'm surprised you haven't heard.
- I have not.
- Hmm.
So much for the gossiping
biddies of Chandrila.
It's a recent development.
[clicks tongue] And it's not what
I wanted to talk to you about.
I know you said
you got my message.
I was hoping we could
discuss the Foundation.
Is there a problem?
[smacks lips] Not like that. No.
[Runai] Oh, Mon. There you are.
- Hello, Tay. Yeah.
- Hello.
- They've had their first fight.
- Oh, dear.
Hmm. Leida's run off.
- You'll have to excuse me.
- Of course.
We'll find time together.
[Runai] Davo just told
me about you and Marni...
[server] Thank you.
- [Leida whimpering]
- Leida...
Oh...
[sniffles]
Darling.
What's happened?
[crying] He's a child.
Tell me.
What happened?
He won't hold my hand.
I keep trying and he
keeps pushing me away.
I'm sorry.
So...
terribly sorry.
[animals screeching]
[Bardi] It has been two days.
He could've been captured.
He could've run away.
[Gerdis] What you are
talking about is a mutiny.
It's not a mutiny if
no one's in charge.
[chuckles] I was always
Maya's number two.
- In your dreams!
- I was always
- supposed to be in charge.
- I ain't never heard that.
- 'Cause you never listen, skug.
- I wanna hear it from Maya.
- That might take a while.
- She's dead.
- [Nazy] She's not.
- You saw nothing.
- You were hiding in the bunker.
- That's a lie.
- I saw you.
- Yeah, you tell him, Rika.
Step off, Rowd!
Maya comes back and we're not here,
there's gonna be noise about it.
- You take it back.
- Get stuffed!
- See what you've done?
- Your brother stole our ship.
Say it again!
- [all exclaim]
- [Nazy] Bad idea, Crab.
Tell him to put it down.
Crab, come on, man.
- He took off...
- [man] You're a cheater!
[man 2] Easy, easy.
[Crab] Call me a liar.
You're not even good at that.
[grunts]
- Skug!
- [man 3] Why?
- Why'd you do that?
- Go. Go, go, go!
[woman] Go! Go, go, go!
[man 3] Drop it,
drop it! Drop it!
- Stay down!
- [gasping]
- [man 4] Run. Run!

Get him up! Come on, come on!

[Niya] It's prepped for a

- The password tonight is Kafrene.
- Kafrene.
[powering up]
[engines roaring]
[Cassian] Okay, I got this.
[Tay] There you are.
- [Mon] Tay!
- How's the bride-to-be?
[Mon] <i>Very spoiled
at the moment.</i>
[Tay] <i>If not now, when, right?</i>
[Krennic] <i>No notes.</i>
No records.
None of you were here.
Your colleagues? Superiors?
If they're not in this room,
they're not cleared
for the project.
[powering down]
[Gerdis] <i>You can
stop right there!</i>
You got 15 blasters
pointed at you right now!
[grunting]
- He's gotta teach her.
- Why would he do that?
- If he doesn't, we'll kill him.
- He can't teach her if he's dead.
Everything with you is negative.
[Gerdis] Like killing
the only pilot we have?
[Flek] <i>We gotta have one of 'em.</i>
You think you're hard to read?
Now you have a plan already. You had
it before they finished speaking.
I want your assessment.
Propaganda will
only get you so far.
You need a radical
insurgency you can count on.
You need Ghorman rebels you can
depend on to do the wrong thing.
Once we're in the
air, he's in control.
- Why are there two?
- You're not getting anywhere.
You're not letting
her concentrate!
So, who's really in charge here?
[all scream]
We should've heard
from him by now.
I can't transmit
from here, Luthen.
I told you when we landed.
That's off the table.
What is it?
[Beela] I'm not sure.
[Brasso] <i>I spoke to Kellen. He said
they haven't done this in years.</i>
[Bix] What are they doing?
An Imperial Supply
Census. It's an audit.
If they're checking
visas, we have a problem.
He knows that.
I know you said
you got my message.
I was hoping we could
discuss the Foundation.
Is there a problem?
[Rika] You were
hiding in the bunker.
- [Crab] You take it back.
- [Rika] Get stuffed!

Is that what she's doing?
I can't tell.

[breathes heavily]
No body. Just a boot.
- Crab's boot?
- You just left it out there?
His foot was still in it!
A stump of bloody foot.
- Animals got 'em.
- [Bayso] What else could it be?
- [Gerdis] You sure?
- I picked it up.
[Cassian] Hey! It's
not gonna rain forever.
You might wanna bank some water.
There's a tarp over there.
Before we go in...
I don't want the
Ghorman project.
I've thought it through all
night. And I don't want it.
Humbling, isn't it?
Both of us reminded of our
place in the chain of command.
I'm not sure I know
what you mean, sir.
Did Krennic offer you the job?
- You know that he did.
- Then it's done. We're in it.
And what about Axis?
That's where I belong.
I can't do both.
Axis?
You've invested
almost two years.
You've built the legend and
delivered almost nothing.
We're getting
closer all the time.
"He's here. He's there.
He's everywhere."
He's nowhere!
Next time, catch them first.
Then make them famous.
This will appear
to be a demotion.
You'll have to play the part.
It will heat up soon enough.
This is good news, Dedra.
Ghorman will be yours to run as you
wish. You'll only answer to Krennic
and he's got no time for
anything but results.
Ghorman is a gift.
Take it.
Then win it.
[ ♪ somber music playing]
[Luthen] Please.
You wanna turn it.
Help him.
Guide that. That's it.
[indistinct chatter]
[Kleya] It's still in one piece?
Good luck getting
it out of here.
Now what? We sit all day?
Well, we'll site
it. We'll light it.
Sculdun will change his
mind and we'll move it.
Then he'll reconsider.
Clean it up and we'll
make it lovely and...
Gently there!
Then we'll sit all day.
Nothing.
Radio silence.
Nobody's checked in.
I know I said we shouldn't
broadcast from here,
but I tried to reach out to Bix.
I never got through.
Mina-Rau's been shut down.
"Temporary reception outage
for Imperial inspection."
What kind of inspection?
Wouldn't that be nice to know.
I need to be at the gallery.
I can't help anyone from
here. I need serious comms.
I can't leave. You'd
have to get a ride.
I've found one.
[Mon] Good morning.
You ate already.
I was up early.
[Perrin] They're sneaking
in Sculdun's surprise.
I'm sure you've heard
what it is by now.
Is it really a Chandi Merle?
Yeah, one of them.
It's a bit gross, don't you think? It's
probably worth more than the house.
- You'll want to put that in your speech.
- [chuckles]
Last night was successful.
- Two more to go.
- Mmm.
You should tell your
boyfriend to back off the nog.
And who's my boyfriend?
Oh. What have you done?
- Thrown him over?
- [scoffs]
I don't know who
we're talking about.
Tay Kolma. Is he not your lover?
Haven't heard that
nonsense in a while.
His wife has run off,
so the field is clear.
- He's all yours now.
- Stop.
Well, maybe you've all dropped him.
That would explain a great deal.
Like what?
It's always best to let them down
gently, or so I've been told.
We have a long day, Perrin.
Tay had a bit too much
First Night punch.
He had to be taken home.
I mean, it's a full-on
Chandi wedding.
He grew up four valleys
away, he should know better.
Pace yourself or pay the price.
He was always weak.

[droid chirping]
Did they remember the juice?
[Aneth] Finally.
[Kellen] I'll load
in when I get back.
How's it going?
We're getting there.
I spoke to my friend
at Five Hundred.
She thinks they'll finish
inspecting up there today.
Where they go next should tell us
what direction they're moving, but...
How many are there?
[Kellen] On the ground?
She counted about 40. We don't
know what they have in the air.
- What if they come this way?
- Look, they need the grain.
They know we need help and
they know everyone isn't legal.
How hard they look,
what they do...
It's been ten years since the
last audit. Nobody's happy.
- Talia thinks they'd let us slide.
- We can't count on that.
- What if they ask where we came from?
- I wouldn't mention Ferrix.
- What if we stay ahead of them?
- [Kellen] I'd be careful.
They caught someone
running at Five Hundred.
[♪ uneasy music playing]
I'll find out what I can.
Cassian?
He'll be here.
[Brasso] Thank you, friend.
[Kellen] We'll get through it.
I'll stop by later.
[Brasso] Be careful.
[birds chirping]
[Gerdis] Meal bars?
- [Bayso] Nine.
- [Plug] That's it?
- Well, two look a bit moldy.
- That's all that's left?
- You voted to eat.
- And you should've told us "no."
- [Plug] How many snak-pods?
- [Bayso] Wet or dry?
- [grunts]
- [Plug] I'm not eating moldy.
[Snur] You get hungry enough...
Look, six dry, eight wet.
I'd rather be hungry than sick.
Let's give him a moldy
and see what happens.
[Cassian] You know...
they've gone very
quiet over there.
You need a perimeter.
I was just about to do that.
That's a good idea.
[Flek] They must be starving.
[all groaning]
[Neek] How can it smell
that bad that fast?
[Bardi] Try it.
[Neek retches] No. No.
I don't know.
[grunts]
- Eat it.
- Why me?
You'll eat anything.
You ate those trogs.
- That was a dare.
- Okay, I dare you.
Give it.
If it tastes like it smells...

[Syril] There are no small jobs
here at the Bureau of Standards.
You may hear that and wonder
how that can be true, but...
not that long ago, I was
standing right where you are now.
I was given a position
in Fuel Purity.
Just over there.
[snaps fingers]
I found an entry on a Varnesian
input account that didn't match.
Two hundred Kovarn
charging rods.
Doesn't seem like much, does it?
Well, I walked it back.
Every shift, I'd make time from my
quota to dig just a little bit deeper.
Then one day, after
months of searching,
screens started lighting
up across the room.
[inhales deeply]
I had uncovered a cabal of
corrupt purchasing agents
who were stealing Imperial
supplies in four sectors.
[gulps nervously]
There's a future here...
for those who dare.

- Hi.
Just finishing up?
Just replacing the bushings.
Have you seen the new silos?
I have. We were based in the Six
Hundred block a few months ago.
I'm not sure they're
worth the cost.
[chuckles nervously]
I guess we'll know
after this next harvest.
I guess so.

So quiet out here.
It's a simple life, isn't it?
It is.
Mechanics, though. [chuckles]
You get to move around a
bit, right? [taps machine]
Yeah, it's true.
Have you been to the Rau?
Some of these farmers live
their whole lives and never go.
It's not much of a city, but you'd
think over time, they'd get curious.
[Bix] I've been there.
[air hissing]
It's changed. Rau.
I hadn't seen it in a few years.
We had a decent meal
there last night.
It's not that far.
It's a beautiful
ride over the fields.
I'm only here for
another couple of days.
Maybe you'd like to join me.
I'm not sure my
husband would approve.
Ah.
Sorry to hear that.
Is he here?
He's off-planet for a few days.
Is he a mechanic as well?
A very good one.
Does he worry about you?
In what way?
We've just shut
down all the comms.
It's not up to
me. It's a policy.
We freeze the zone
during an audit.
It's supposed to stop things sneaking
away while we're doing all our counting.
That's good to know.
[Brasso] Zala.
[Bix] I'm done. You ready?
Yeah. Sorry.
[Krole] Hello.
What's your Council?
[Bix] We're based in 207.
[Brasso] We move around.
We go where there's a need.
Like this.
Well...
nice to meet you.
See you along the way.

[Perrin] I'd come up here with
my uncles. It was good hunting.
It was all private
back then, of course.
Signs up everywhere.
Keep the poachers out.
I remember the signs.
Didn't stop you.
I wasn't much for warnings.
Well, hasn't been bad for
business though, has it?
[Sculdun chuckles]
- I've always wanted to.
- I see.
Mother wouldn't allow it.
It'll be different now.
[indistinct conversation]
Having fun?
[Vel sighs] When was the
last time this happened?
[Mon] Wedding
hike? Perrin and I.
- It rained.
- [Vel] Ah. I remember.
Is Leida happy? Is this
really what she wants?
Everything old is new again.
As if I needed another
reason to stay away.
What happens at the
top? I don't remember.
We gaze at the ancestral
lands. Some children sing.
The Elder waves her hand and
we'll all have been purified.
[Vel sighs]
No word from your friend?
- Cinta?
- Mmm.
No.
Luthen knows, but
he won't tell me.
That's not acceptable.
If she wanted to
see me, she would.
It was never going
to be perfect.
Or good, really.
Bad timing.
I'm sorry.
Well, there's work to be done.
Yeah, we have to live to
do it, though, don't we?
[insects trilling]
- He should be back by now.
- [Gerdis] I think I know that.
What if they've grabbed him?
[Gerdis] We'd hear about it.
- I don't know about that.
- They could be messing with us.
Taking it to another level.
- How is that another level?
- Snatching him?
- If Plug was a hostage...
- [Snur] That changes everything.
How would that change anything?
We have the pilot.
They have a ship that
goes nowhere without us.
- They could have more food than we think.
- And you can't trust Plug with food.
He'd flip sides for a meal.
Yeah, he'd sure be at
the front of the line.
They don't have any food. Do
they have any food on that ship?
No.
[Gerdis] We have the food.
[Flek] Not really.
I just ate my meal bar.
- All of it?
- Hold on.
[Plug yells]
- [Snur] It's Plug!
- [Plug] Don't shoot!

This is remarkable.
[Mon] Mmm.
No one's seen anything
like this for a long time.
Well, perhaps there's
good reason for that.
- [indistinct chatter]
- [chuckles]
And I know apologies
are in order.
I've been so distracted by
all of this. It's impossible.
I was whining.
It's the last thing
anyone wants to listen to.
You've been having a difficult time.
That's when we need to be heard.
I have called your office.
And I've been remiss.
The last time we spoke, you told
me you had new business coming in.
You told me you were waiting.
I think I told you I
was tired of waiting.
This is sounding serious.
It wasn't then.
It might not be now.
I still have several things
pending, it's just...
I have concerns.
The Foundation is
up and running.
Your financial blemishes
have been smoothed over
without anyone being the wiser.
Davo Sculdun obviously
has what he came for.
[♪ somber music playing]
Everyone seems quite pleased
with how they've landed,
and I'm left wondering about
the risk I've taken on.
Please say something.
I'm shocked.
I'm sorry. I feel terrible.
I really had no idea.
Do you know, the irony is it's
the rebellion that's hurt me most.
Rebel activity soured
my investments.
You can see how I might feel...
undervalued.
[breathes shakily]
Absolutely.
How I wish you'd made
this clear sooner.
Yeah, I should've.
Perhaps I thought
it was obvious.
If I haven't, I'm
sorry for that.
Well...
Let me get through this weekend and
I promise we'll figure something out.
I hate having to
say all this, Mon.
Oh.
To an old friend?
After all you've
done for me? Please.
Now, let's celebrate.
Indeed.
[Kellen] I chatted up one
of the soldiers today.
They're moving tomorrow.
[Bix] Where they headed?
It looks like they're going
to Three Hundred next,
but there's no guarantee.
What if we move behind
them to Five Hundred
and just wait till they're done?
Most of the arrests have
been people running.
There must be work there.
[Kellen] We can't move all this.
They want to know
who is living here.
I'll say it's me. I'm legal.
[Kellen] We're doing
everything we can.
Thank you.

Don't thank me yet.
Not until these
bastards are gone.
We'll have to see what they do.

- [Mon] I'm just stunned.
With no warning?
Well, I suppose I have been
avoiding him. Now I know why.
Perrin said he had to be
carried home last night.
His wife's left him...
Was there a number?
I said I'd get into it once
we'd survived the wedding.
So nothing specific.
Well, he's had some
bad investments.
He sees all this...
It's very troubling.
We'll find a number.
Is there any chance
he'd go to Sculdun?
No, he wouldn't dare.
He can't.
[glasses clinking]
It's Perrin. He's about
to speak. I have to go.
Wait.
We can't leave this
be. You must know that.
I will set a meeting on

We will find a number.

the galaxy will deliver
a daily basket of
fresh anxieties
- to your door without fail.

But my <i>solom...</i>
My <i>solom seyna...</i>
The Elders know what I'm
talking about, right?
My hope... My hope...
My hope is that you learn to reach
past this constant cloud of sadness.
Pleasure. Gaiety. Amusement.
These are the hidden things.
The music buried beneath
all that noise...
- Joy. Joy!
- [scattered laughter]
Joy...
But joy has no wind at its back.
Joy will not announce its arrival.
You need to listen for it,
and be mindful of how fleeting
and delicate it can be.
But search out these treasures.
A moment of... of
pleasing sensation,
the memory of laughter
and good company,
the comfort of a fine meal.
And for me... [chuckles]
For me, right now, it's
the smile that I can't hide
as I see these two young people
sharing our greatest tradition.

[Gerdis] Didn't get
very far, did you?
[Bardi] We're not done yet!
[Gerdis] You'll starve
before you get there!
What's the plan anyway?
Shoot the pilot?
Kill us all?
That'll get you out of here!
You can't live on these melons!
How's he know that?
They've been sneaking.
What is the plan?
Shut up.
[Bardi] Are you backing down?
[Gerdis] I'm
dropping a challenge!

No shooting unless

Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Oi!

Watch him. Eyes open.

[Bardi] That's far enough.
I'll count to three.
Everything... means everything.

Three.

Droppin' their weapons.

Wait there.
No weapons. No comms.
No credit. No nonsense.
In you go.
Upstairs lounge is closed tonight.
You pay at the end.
Don't even think about it.
She'll send you home cryin'.
Welcome.
Hello.
Alone tonight?
- Just me.
- Hmm.
- Have you been with us before?
- First time.
Well, you picked a great night.
It's sort of been quiet this evening.
Excuse me.
We were here first.
Yeah, we've been waiting.
He just got here.
Gani will help you.
I don't want Gani.
Behave.
Oh, she's funny, ain't she?
My apologies.
You should take care of them.
Why?
It's a company town.
Oh, they're just sentry guards.
They like to play at being cops.
It's... It's annoying.
- Hello, guys.
- Where were we?
You were telling me how quiet it was.
Looking for something special tonight?
A friend of mine said there was a girl
from Kenari working here.
Kenari?
It was a small Mid Rim system.
I've heard of it.
It's not your girlfriend or something,
is it?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Are you from Kenari? Nostalgic, are we?
Let me go and check on that for you.
Is there something amusing?
What?
You keep looking over here
like there's something funny.
Definitely not.
What does that mean?
Oh, that is a hard look
for a little thing like you.
Yeah, he's not laughing now, is he?
There was a girl from Kenari,
but she left several months ago.
We do have a lovely lady
here tonight from Tahina
who's got those big dark eyes
you're looking for.
This girl from Kenari,
any idea where she went?
What are you? Seriously.
Boyfriend? Husband?
I'm looking for my sister.
Well, whoever she is, she's not here.
She disappeared.
People come and go.
You should leave.
What was her name?
Nobody here gives their real name.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on there.
No weapons. No comms.
No credit. No nonsense.
Hey! Scrawno! Slow down.
Slow down!
Stop! Stop right there!
You're in Pre-Mor corporate zone.
You know that, right?
Employees are required
to present their IDs upon request.
Oh, no, you didn't park
out past the causeway, did ya?
I sure hope not.
That's off-limits to visitors.
We'd have to fine you.
Yeah, I mean, you know
about the visitor's curfew, right?
Yeah, we'd have to impound your ride.
Tough break.
What if he swum over?
You swim over, scrawno?
Yeah, he's not laughing anymore.
If you've got Corpo ID,
now would be the time to pull it out.
Gonna have to see it, big stuff.
There you go.
I got 300 credits in my coat pocket.
What are the chances on that?
That is almost exactly what it costs
to cover the fine.
The towing charge
and our personal processing fee.
Everybody's lucky night.
Let's have a look at it.
I'm not moving.
You want it, you take
it and I walk away.
I don't need any surprises.
Have at it.
No. Other pocket.
Tell me now.
Tell me what to do!
Let's hear it, boss!
Get up. Get him up.
Get him up!
Move!
He's not breathing.
- No.
- Verlo! Verlo!
- He's faking.
- He's not!
Verlo!
You killed him.
You didn't mean it.
He fell.
We had a misunderstanding, and...
We'll go in together.
We played too hard in hitting,
and you didn't understand it.
He tried to grab you, and...
and he fell, and he hit his head.
We'll go in together.
We'll tell them what happened.
C-C-Cassian.
I brought what you t-t-told me.
Cassian. Kassa. Kassa.
Kassa! Kassa!
But where were you?
It's not important.
If it's not important, why not tell me?
Cassian?
Who came by the house last night?
Jezzi and Femmi brought supper
and Maarva's medicine,
and then Jezzi came back b-b-because...
Anybody looking for me?
B-B-Brasso. Brasso was looking for you.
What did you tell him?
Maarva told him...
Told him what?
Pausing for data lag.
Tell me what she said.
Bee!
Maarva said you were out
ruining your health and reputation
with friends of low character.
She told him sooner or later
you were going to
g-g-get yourself into trouble
you couldn't talk your way out of.
Then she told Brasso that...
Enough!
Come here.
Listen to me. It's important.
I know it takes a lot of energy,
but can you make a lie for me?
I can lie.
I have adequate power reserves.
Don't tell anybody you saw me.
Don't tell anybody you know where I am.
That's two lies.
Let's have both.
I will have to recharge at home.
Take your time on the way back.
I got to hurry.
I can't come with you?
Not now. I don't have time.
I'm sorry.
I'm late. Wait. What's this?
Hold still. Hold still.
Take your time.
Let's get to it.
- Grab mine.
- Yeah, grab those two now.
Brasso will catch you up.
Hey.
You don't look so good.
I'm fine.
- I came by for you last night.
- Yeah, I know.
What'd you do when you left?
Uh, I was tired. I went home, cleaned
up a bit, and then I fell asleep.
No. You came by for me,
but I wasn't there.
So then you started home,
and you saw me at the Hotel Bridge.
We decided we were thirsty,
and you wanted to go to Cavo's.
But I said that was no good because
there's too many people
there I owe money.
You're serious?
Yeah.
Who's gonna be asking?
So Cavo's was out.
But then you remembered you still had
half a bottle of nog stashed at home.
So we went there
and drank ourselves to sleep.
Please. I really need this.
You insulted my choice of beverage.
As host and provider,
I was offended by this.
You failed to gauge
the depth of my irritation.
You rose to make
your point more vocally.
I was helping you back
into your chair when you fell.
You were gone when I woke up.
You've come here now to apologize.
I accept your apology.
Hey, Brasso, let's go.
Do me this.
Whatever this is, when it's done,
pull your boots on and get to work.
You look like a wreck.
I knew I could count on you.
I'm not lending you any money.
I knew that, too.
Tell your mother she can afford
to put the heating on.
It was freezing there last night.
Make yourself useful.
This is quite the report.
This happened when?
Last night, sir.
I knew you were leaving this morning,
and I wanted to make sure you had all
the information before your departure.
You've been very busy.
Two men are dead, sir.
Employees.
If that's not worth staying up for,
then I'm not worthy of the uniform.
Have you modified your uniform?
Perhaps slightly.
Pockets, piping, and...
and some light tailoring.
I know one of these men. Kravas.
That's another reason I wanted this
to get immediate attention.
He was a squad commander on Four.
He's fallen a great deal since then.
He was a Sentry Corporal here on One.
No mystery there.
He's lucky he wasn't killed years ago.
One of the most unpleasant people
I've ever met.
There's no suspect at this point?
We have some excellent leads.
"A human with dark features
asking about a Kenari girl"
"who might have been working
in the establishment."
Are there no witnesses to the actual
crime? It's usually quite busy there.
Apparently not.
This happened just outside the district,
- at the plaza entrance to the causeway.
- I know.
- There's an intersection...
- I said I know it.
- Were they robbed?
- No, sir.
Tough case.
Bad timing.
I'm sure that in several days,
with the proper resources,
- I can bring this case to a...
- Stop!
And I don't mean just the talking.
I mean stop.
This case appears to bear
all the hallmarks
of what I like to describe
as regrettable misadventure.
Sir?
Two dedicated Pre-Mor employees
caught in the sad orbit
of a rare calamity.
I don't understand.
I want you to conjure
a suitable accident.
- But...
- And let's make sure
it's on the far side of the plaza.
Let's get it outside the Leisure Zone.
- But they were murdered.
- No.
They were killed in a fight.
They were in a brothel,
which we're not supposed to have,
the expensive one,
which they shouldn't be able to afford,
drinking Revnog,
which we're not supposed to allow.
Both of them supposedly on the job,
which is a dismissible offense.
They clearly harassed
a human with dark features
and chose the wrong person to annoy.
I suspect they died rushing
to aid someone in distress.
Nothing too heroic.
We don't need a parade.
They died being helpful.
Something sad but inspiring
in a mundane sort of way.
You look stricken, Deputy Inspector.
Are you absorbing my meaning here?
Trying, sir.
When I said bad timing,
I wasn't referring to the fact
that you spent all night worrying this.
I meant that
I am on my way this very morning
to an Imperial Regional Command review,
where I'll be asked to make a report
about our crime rates,
and the goal of that speech,
should you ever be asked to deliver it,
is brevity.
Minimizing the time the Empire spends
thinking about Preox-Morlana
benefits our superiors
and, by extension,
everyone here
at the Pre-Mor Security Inspection team,
which at the moment includes you.
Don't put your feet on my desk
in my absence,
and let's have an accident
report waiting when I get back.
Yeah, tell him that 15,000
is the best he's gonna get.
She's in the yard.
Yes, Yes, we can do that.
I'm busy.
I'll be quick.
What?
- Your friend.
- What friend?
The one who buys. Your secret friend.
How fast can you reach him?
What happened to you?
I fell.
On what? A jealous husband?
I have something to sell.
Don't we all?
How soon could he be here?
I was planning to reach out
at the end of the month.
No. This would have to be now.
Yeah, for what? For one item?
No. That's not how it works.
I bundle things before I make contact.
Bix. Bix. Come on.
There's a Tac Corvette coming
in this week looking for scrap.
I'm told there's a rack
of Imperial targeting units
someone might forget to strip out.
We'll get that, that thing you've got.
Got a few Naval com-scans...
- I can't wait that long.
- Why?
What have you done?
Your friend will want this piece.
He'll come for this.
You said he wanted to meet me.
So, what is it?
What is it?
I got an untraceable NS-9 Starpath unit.
Vector crystals and Imperial seal
still intact.
How long have you had that?
I need to move it, Bix.
- You've been hiding it.
- Saving it.
I'm guessing it comes
from one of my bids.
- Guess again.
- Not your best move, Cassian.
So, what?
You want to call your guy or not?
- Do you know how much that's worth?
- Yeah.
Enough to get out of here,
lay low till things cool off.
- I need to relocate for a while.
- You've been holding out on me.
And you've been skimming off the top.
So let's not get emotional.
You'll need an alternative plan...
No, no. The answer's no.
You don't know what
I'm about to suggest.
- I'm not selling this to you, Bix.
- Come on.
I didn't hang on to this
to have a partner.
I need every credit
I can put my hands on to...
Are we bidding on the
Wobani run tomorrow?
What?
There's a Wobani run coming.
Jeef wants to know if we're in on it.
He'll know when I'm ready.
Yeah, are you...
What?
Well, it looks like it's turned
into something more than work.
Do I ask about your personal life?
Just promise he knows nothing
about any of this.
He'd do anything for me.
No. No, no. That wasn't my question.
No. He knows nothing about any of it.
Bix, you said he wanted to meet me.
I really need this.
I'll let him know.
Now, go fix your face.
Four of these, five of these.
Transport at once, once we get payment.
Mm-hmm.
She seems upset.
It's good to see you, Timm.
Seems like that happens
every time you come around.
I wouldn't worry.
She's tougher than both of us.
I'm getting tired of hearing that.
Then you'd better find yourself
a less-complicated woman.
Good luck with that.
Kassa!
Ey!
Everything okay, sir?
Fine.
Thank you.
Forward.
Forward.
Forward.
Wait. Wait, wait. Go
back. Go back. That.
What is that?
I'm not quite sure, sir.
Sublight something.
Orlean Star Cab or a Dayvan.
Some old thing.
And this something just strolls
through the checkpoint?
No identification whatsoever,
just wanders into points unknown?
The nights get busy.
You know the traffic.
I don't know what's more disturbing,
the fact our borders are unprotected
or your complacence about it.
Find it. Whatever it is, I want to know
when it left and where it went.
You'd have to filter the entire night.
Well, if it's too much for you,
let me know.
I'm sure somebody wants the chair.
- Hey, Cass.
- Hey.
- Good to see...
- What's the hurry?
- Got some place to be?
- Yeah.
What, not happy to see me?
- What, no love for Nurchi?
- No, I'm late, okay?
I know. I want my deposit back.
I wish I could, but it's in play.
Just waiting to hear they're on-site.
Okay?
Vetch?
Seriously?
I'm not one of these losers
gonna let you float
until they forget how much you owe them.
You're here with him.
To what?
To threaten me?
Vetch, you let him talk you into this?
The subject is money.
- I just asked you a question.
- What?
Since when do you
take orders from Nurchi?
Don't answer that.
- You need work this bad?
- Leave him out of it.
He said all I needed
to do was stand here.
Good.
You keep at it.
You think I'm messing around?
I hope so.
I'm gonna do us a favor
and not mention this happened.
Vetch, very nice to see you.
What?
I'll be back.
- What's up?
- Errands. Won't be long.
Dad.
Haven't seen you lately.
Some of us work.
What are we looking for?
Bendine Mesh-Tech filter.
Yellow racks in the back.
You might have to dig a little.
- Thanks.
- Good luck with it.
Look alive. He's on his way up.
Is he even allowed to approve overtime?
- That's his problem.
- Not if we don't get it.
Well, it'll be his
name in the time scan.
- Ferrix!
- Yes, sir, we've been working on it.
Kenari human males on Ferrix.
I'm afraid that's a blank, sir.
What?
But we have got a Imperial census.
How old is it?
This is six years ago.
That's an eternity.
There's not a lot about Kenari, sir.
It's fairly obscure.
That should make it easier.
We'll have to put the word out.
- On Ferrix?
- Where else would we put it?
We don't have presence there, sir.
- Is it not under our jurisdiction?
- Technically.
We are simply asking for information.
Have you ever been there?
What difference does that make?
They have their own way of doing things.
This is the murder
of two Pre-Mor employees!
Put out a bulletin.
Kenari human men wanted for questioning.
Slam their channels. Flood it.
Set up a desk here
to monitor anything that comes in.
Let's go!
- What do you think you're doing?
- Forgot something.
Now? He's in the office.
I refueled it. Just like you told me.
And now I'm almost done.
What is that? Is that the ID chip log?
It's the old one.
I'm just putting a blank in right now.
Pegla! Pegla!
What in the name of Chobb
is going on out there?
I think the yard rats are back.
There's a customer out front.
Get those hounds
to start earning their keep.
Why are you swapping chip logs?
You're gonna get us both in trouble.
I didn't like the way
it was running last night.
So you're doing me a favor?
Leave it better than you found it.
The way you always do.
The Cassian way.
I was gonna ask if I could
borrow it again tomorrow.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
Close this out.
Don't come back.
- Come on, Pegla.
- No, no, no.
No.
We're done. No more
favors. No more deals.
- Listen, this...
- Don't.
I don't want to know
what you're doing or why
or where you took this thing last night
or any of it.
Finish up. Get out.
Don't come back.
Kassa.

No weapons. No comms.
No credit. No nonsense.
A friend of mine said there
was a girl from Kenari working here.
I'm looking for my sister.
People come and go.
You should leave.
Wh... What was her name?
Nobody here gives their real name.
Excuse me. We were here first.
Oh, that is a hard look
for a little thing like you.
Stop right there!
He's not breathing.
You killed him.
You've been very busy.
Two men are dead, sir.
Employees.
If that's not worth staying up for,
then I'm not worthy of the uniform.
I know one of these men.
He was a squad commander on Four.
One of the most unpleasant people
I've ever met.
- But they were murdered.
- No. They were killed in a fight.
They clearly harassed
a human with dark features
and chose the wrong person to annoy.
- I have something to sell.
- What?
I got an untraceable NS-9 Starpath unit.
Your friend will want this piece.
What is that?
Find it. Whatever it is, I want to know
when it left and where it went.
Let's go!
Kassa!
Shut the door.
Scram! Get out of it!
Everythin' okay?
Just tired.
Too tired for a meal?
Was that the plan?
Could be.
I thought we said one night a week.
Let's, uh, start the week tonight.
Let's do this.
Why don't we do something fun
tomorrow night?
There's a plan.
Just lock up the back.
I'll take care of all this.
- Thank you.
- Yep.
Don't you say a word.
I mean it.
There you are.
Don't you look comfortable.
Hey.
Hey, Bee.
Everything okay?
Oh. Oh, this?
Oh, I need a wash. Uh...
I was helping Pegla
and tripped on a cable.
- You've been busy.
- Yeah.
I ran into Brasso last night.
We had a lot to talk about.
Mmm, sounds fascinating.
I would have come home this morning,
but everything I had going on
was over East.
I've been trying to get back all day.
I'm gonna go get cleaned up.
Read it to him, Bee.
Read what?
I c-c-can speak now?
Read it.
"P-P-Pre-Mor Authority
is seeking a Kenari male resident"
"of Ferrix for questioning."
"Citizens with any information
should contact"
"the Preox-Morlana Security HQ
without d-d-delay."
Who else knows?
About what?
That you were born in Kenari.
You don't want to hear what happened?
Mmm-hmm, we'll get to that. But
who knows? Who have we told?
I don't know. I...
We have always said Fest.
Every doc I've ever submitted
has always said you were born on Fest.
Have you ever said anything
other than Fest?
Officially, no.
I don't think so. But people, yes.
- Who?
- Uh... And so did you.
- Well, how many?
- I don't know.
It's not something
I've been keeping track of!
Well, everyone I've told is dead.
That's ridiculous.
- Jezzi. Sammo. Hmm?
- That's family.
If we're making a list,
we're making a list.
Well, it's all your women
that I'm worried about.
- Oh, come on. Please. Stop. Stop!
- Femmi, Karla, Sondreen.
There are some names I don't even know!
B-B-Bix.
Bix has nothing to do with this!
But then who told these
Pre-Mor bastards about Kenari?
That would be me.
Bix. B-B-Bix is l-l-looking for you.
- What?
- Well, why would you do that?
When? When? When did she call? Just now?
What? Tell me.
- C-C-Comm fail. Your comms.
- Bee, where is she?
- How did that come up?
- Come on.
- Just forget that.
- Is she still in the yard?
- What do they want?
- Bee? Wait!
Bee, where is she?
C-c-comms access throttle.
C-c-calculating reroute.
Cassian.
What have you done?
I messed up.
Haven't been here in a while.
I wasn't sure what was safe.
You saw the notice.
What did you do?
Two guys jumped me. It went too far.
How far is too far?
They were shaking me down.
I wasn't looking for a fight.
Listen, forget what I said this morning.
I'll sell you the piece.
I just need enough to get out of here.
He's coming.
The buyer's coming.
It's too late to call him off.
He'll be here in the morning.
Hey.
I won't forget this.
You should go.
Yeah. Okay.
You called him, right?
He's on his way up.
Cassian Andor. This says he's from Fest.
This was a tip call, right?
Probably someone messing with us.
- I don't see Kenari here.
- Hold on. I have an image.
"Insurrection,
destruction of Imperial property,"
"assault on Imperial soldier."
Check the database.
See if it says anything about Kenari.
We have a suspect?
Not sure yet. We're
about to get an image.
Who is it?
Is it too late?
Your light was on.
I'm here.
Yeah, I... I see that.
Uh, no, I meant...
I meant, yes, it's not too late.
I couldn't sleep.
- But if it's not a good time, then...
- No. No. Not at all.
I'm just... I'm surprised.
Good.
Do you want something to drink or...
No. I've had enough.
You all right?
I am now.
Sergeant Linus Mosk
at your service, sir.
Sorry to roust you
in the middle of the night.
No, sir. Privilege, sir.
Got the brief on the ride in.
I'd like to move on this quickly.
We have a dangerous, mobile suspect
in a very serious crime.
Couldn't agree more, sir.
Tempo is crucial.
Velocity in the service
of inspired leadership,
is there a worthy substitute?
I think not.
It's one suspect.
How many men do you think we'd need?
I'd say 12, sir, just to be prudent.
Will you be suiting up with us, sir?
- I think I should. Don't you?
- Absolutely, sir.
Show of force. Boost morale.
Nothin' like seein'
an officer on the line.
- Excellent.
- If I may, sir,
hats off to you and Chief Inspector.
Two men dead, line of duty, colleagues?
- It's outrageous.
- Exactly!
The thought of anything less than
full engagement on a case like this...
Unconscionable, sir.
- Dereliction of duty, at the minimum.
- It would be, wouldn't it?
I've seen it, sir.
Half measures.
The take-it-slow, the wait-and-see.
It's a plague on discipline.
Face your men, yourself,
the rest of your life,
knowing you did less
than everything you possibly could?
I've been saying all along
we need a stronger hand
with these affiliated planets.
There's fomenting out there, sir.
Pockets of fomenting.
Corporate Tactical Forces
are the Empire's first line of defense,
and the best way to keep
the blade sharp is to use it.
So, well,
thank you, sir.
I'll pass along your kind words
to the Chief Inspector.
Sir!
Psst. Kassa.
Optimize landing.
Landing scanned and locked.
How long a walk this time?
The shuttle will be 2.3 klicks away.
There's nothing closer?
Nothing safe.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Ah, couldn't sleep.
Tell me you have caf.
Was just about to put it on.
Can you open up the yard
for me this morning?
Uh, sure.
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Just, um... Just tired.
What's up this mornin'?
Just got a few errands to run.
Won't be long.
I'm sure I had some comms in here.
It's crap.
Why do we n-n-need comms?
Here we go.
You could just come and t-tell me.
You haven't been listening to me,
have you?
You have to go away.
And?
You have c-c-credits for Maarva.
You need to t-t-tell me
where you're hiding them.
Because we don't want someone else
to find Maarva's credits, do we?
I agree.
You should stay.
If I can bring them myself, I will.
But if I can't, we need
the comms, right?
Bee...
Going is a b-b-bad idea.
You need to get back.
She's gonna wonder where you are.
Come on.
Go!
Bee?
Bee?
Bee?
If you've powered down back here again,
I'll be so upset with you.
Hmm.
Mmm.
You're wrong.
It's the confidence that's irritating.
I am looking it up!
Hey. Haven't seen you in a while.
- You got a minute?
- I'm just... I'm looking up Kenari.
What's that?
Yeah. He never heard of it either.
"Kenari. Mid Rim."
"Abandoned after
Imperial mining disaster."
Mining. Everyone died.
"Abandoned and considered toxic.
Imperial prohibition."
No, no, there's no reward.
Corporate enforcement
are looking for someone.
You know anybody from Kenari?
What can I do for you?
How much for a run to Tassar?
- When?
- Today.
What would we be picking up?
Give me the price for not knowing.
- Weight?
- Not important.
- Explosive?
- No, no.
- Does it talk?
- Give me a number, Xan.
Nine hundred.
A real number.
You want immediacy and discretion.
That's an expensive combo.
- I got 500.
- Well, you should plan more carefully.
- Okay, let's split the difference.
- It's your choice.
You want to go today
and have me keep my mouth shut?
Seven's my floor.
Okay, if it's seven,
you better be ready in an hour.
Keep the engine running.
Will you let it go?
All right, gentlemen.
Cassian Andor.
Not a recent image,
but the best we've got.
He may not appear to be
a formidable opponent,
but two of our men are dead
having made that mistake.
West Team will include
Deputy Inspector Karn and myself.
We will endeavor to serve
the warrant and exfil rapidly.
North and East Team
will take positions accordingly
for a pincer movement
should the subject attempt to flee.
Andor should be considered
armed and dangerous.
We will have the element of surprise,
but there should be no illusions
as to the risks involved.
There may be some local residents
who are less than enthused
with our presence.
You may remind them
that there's a Territorial Forum
once a month where they are free
to make official complaints.
All yours, sir.
Thank you for being here.
There comes a time when the...
the risk of doing nothing
becomes the greatest risk of all.
This is one of those decisive moments,
and I can't imagine a team I'd
rather share it with than all of you.
There's no room for doubt
on the path to...
success...
and, uh, justice.
Best of luck to us all.
All right, then. Carry on.
Well said, sir.
Inspiring.
You believe this?
Incredible, right?
We're circling.
We're stacked up.
Crazy, right?
We should be charging them.
What'd they stick you to park your ship?
Sixty credits.
Gutty, aren't they?
Chargin' us to come and spend our money.
They get you comin' and goin'.
I'm old enough,
I first came here,
you could drive in across the wasteland.
They had a groundcarry.
Drive right through.
That was no bargain either.
You'd make the round trip
and taste it a week later.
Just nasty.
Now it's this.
What's your line?
Rather not say?
No need to explain.
Who knows
who you're talking to these days.
Me, I'm in propulsion.
We do add-ons and boosters.
Mmm.
Never changes, does it?
You know what they say?
No, what's that?
If you can't find it here,
it's not worth finding.

put out a bulletin last night

I've seen it.
The bulletin doesn't mention him by name.
It says they're looking
for someone from Kenari.
His Imperial prison record
says he's from Fest.
Yeah, that's always been his story.
Has he been identified?
I don't think many people know him.
He killed these men on Morlana?

Is it?
(SCOFFS)
An untraceable Star path Unit.
Vector crystals and seal still intact.
You can track every Imperial coordinate
for nine radial parsecs.
LUTHEN: Is it here?
Is the money here?
How do I know it works?
CASSIAN: It's sealed.
The moment I plug it in, the value drops.
So you could be scamming me. (SCOFFS)
CASSIAN: I'm giving you my word.
LUTHEN: And if that's not enough?
(CHUCKLES)

has he done this time?
(SIGHS) Oh, God.
There was a bulletin last night.
Did you see it?
"Kenari male resident."
(STAMMERING) I need to think.
Just let me think.
Is that what this is about?

Someone ratted him out.
SALMAN: What? What do you mean?

Don't.
Don't? Don't what?
He can take care of himself.

Who?
How do you know who we're talking about?
Did I ever tell you
that Cassian was born on Kenari?
- I don't... I don't... I don't remember.
- Hmm?
BIX: I do.
I remember.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(SOFTLY) How could you?
Wait. (BREATHING HEAVILY)
What is going on?
I can't believe you'd do that.
What did you do?
Timm!
LUTHEN: Where'd you get it?
CASSIAN: What difference does that make?
I see three choices.
Either you're an Imperial spy,
you're fronting for the person
I really want to speak to,
or you're the thing itself.
I see one choice.
Either you got my money or you don't.
(RATTLES)
LUTHEN: So which is it?
I know Bix has her game.
I know you bribe quartermasters
to leave valuables on the ships
before they come in for scrap.
But this isn't that.
This isn't something they'd let pass.
No.
I went in and got this myself.
How? How's that possible?
It was... It was sealed
on the Imperial Naval Base in Steergard.
Look, you got the money. I got the box.
What else is there to talk about?
I'll give you another thousand credits
to tell me how you got it.
(CHUCKLES) Another thousand?
LUTHEN: Done.
How?
(SIGHS)
You just walk in like you belong.
- Takes more than that, doesn't it?
- CASSIAN: What? To steal from the Empire?
What do you need?
A uniform, some dirty hands
and an Imperial tool kit.
(SCOFFS) They're so proud of themselves,
they don't even care.
They're so fat and satisfied,
they can't imagine it.
Can't imagine what?
CASSIAN: That someone like me
would ever get inside their house,
walk their floors,
spit in their food, take their gear.
The arrogance is remarkable, isn't it?
They don't even think about us.
Us? I don't know you.
LUTHEN: Fair enough. But I know you.
These days will end, Cassian And or.
The way they laugh.
The way they push through a crowd.
The sound of that voice
telling you to stop, to go, to move.
Telling you to die.
Rings in the ear, doesn't it?
CASSIAN: Why don't you let me
count that money?
But they'll think about us soon enough.
We should get moving.
Soon enough,
they'll have something else to listen to.
You don't want to get caught with it.
Well, they'd hang me, wouldn't they?
Take me up Rix Road
and hang me in the square.
Wouldn't be the first time, would it?
Isn't that where they hung your father?
- Who are you?
- (GUN COCKING)
What is this?
LUTHEN: I said I know you.
I know all about you.
Yes, I want the box,
and I'll leave with that
if it's all I can get.
I came looking for something more,
and I think I've found it.
I'd like you to come with me.
How do you know about me?
I was hoping
for a more relaxed conversation,
but you're right, we don't have time.
Contrary to what you told me,
I doubt that you'll be stickin' around.
I know you killed two Corpos
at Morlana-One,
and I know they're coming for you.
Seems like such a waste
to let them have you.
Waste of talent.
(WHISPERING) Who are you?
That's the wrong question.
The right question is how much time
do we have to get out of here.
Why would I go anywhere with you?

We just need a speeder.
What's our best option?
West. Into town.

Why?
You're going back to the pod!
By myself?
Get the pod in the air.
Keep your radio on.
Get moving!

Let's get out of here.
North Team heading for Rix Road.

(CRYING)
Timm.
SERGEANT MOSK: Now it's three men?
How is that possible?
They brought the building down. (PANTING)
They've got explosives.
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
What do you mean "they"?
SOLDIER 1: <i>There's two of them.</i>
<i>Two humans. Heavily armed.</i>
<i>- Heading your way.</i>
- SERGEANT MOSK: Keep 'em flanked.
Keep pushing. Keep the channel open.
- Now there's two of 'em?
- Apparently so.
We're just gonna stand here?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Point taken.
We'll split up, take positions,
pick 'em off when they come through.

Pre-Mor Enforcement
put out a bulletin last night
for someone meeting Cassian's description.
<i>The bulletin
doesn't mention him by name.</i>
<i>It says they're looking
for someone from Kenari.</i>
<i>And or should be considered
armed and dangerous.</i>
<i>He may not appear to be
a formidable opponent,</i>
<i>but two of our men are dead
having made that mistake.</i>
Who are you?
I know all about you.
Yes, I want the box,
and I'll leave with that
if it's all I can get.
I know you killed two Corpos
at Morlana-One,
and I know they're coming for you.
Seems like such a waste
to let them have you.
Waste of talent.
We have a warrant for Cassian And or.
Brace yourself.
- Let's go!
- There he is!
How many are you?
- Twelve. Fourteen.
- I swear.
I'd like you to come with me.
Why would I go anywhere with you?
Don't you want to fight
these bastards for real?
There's a medpac.
Blue. Bright blue.
The shelf behind you.
Take hold of something.
- Anyone behind us?
- Set for Aldhani.
<i>Calculating for Aldhani.</i>
- Are they coming?
- Do as I say.
<i>Calculations complete.</i>
What's powering this?
I've been in a Fondor Haulcraft.
I've flown them.
Never seen one do that.
Well, it's been a day of surprises
for all of us.
You're bleeding on my floor.
Fix your arm.
What's Aldhani?
That depends.
I haven't agreed to do anything
but save my skin.
Yeah, and here you are with your skin.
- What's that?
- Med nog.
Just a sip.
Perhaps you got alternatives
I'm not aware of.
Seems to me you have two choices.
Either I drop you somewhere
and you start running
or you come with me
and help with something important.
And, of course, you could try
and kill me and take the ship.
Define "important."
Taking something of real value
from the Empire.
I don't need you to steal.
Seeing how well you're doing on your own.
I'll take the drop-off.
And do what? Continue as you are?
They'll use the same rope to hang you
whether it's for a plasma coil
or 20 million credits.
I'm offering you everything you want,
all at once.
What is "everything I want"?
Since you know so much about me.
To put a real stick
in the eye of the Empire
and get paid for it.
I wondered who you were.
Who am I?
Alliance, Sep, guerilla, Partisan Front.
- One of them.
- Isn't it all the same?
It is to me.
So we agree.
No.
I think it's all useless.
Better to spit in their food
and steal their trinkets.
It's better to live.
Better to eat, sleep, do what you want.
You don't know me.
I fought in Mimban when I was 16.
Two years of it.
Straight out of prison, into the mud.
I'm one of 50 that survived.
And who did it turn out we were fighting?
Ourselves.
So, please...
You were on the ground
in Mimban for six months.
You came in as a cook.
You lived because you ran.
But you're right about one thing.
The Empire had you fighting each other,
which should make you
hate them all the more,
and you do.
I said I know you.
I know the outside.
I know what people tell me when I ask.
The rest, I imagine.
I imagine your hate.
I imagine that no matter
what you tell me or tell yourself,
you'll ultimately die
fighting these bastards.
So what I'm asking is this.
Wouldn't you rather give it all at once
to something real
than carve off useless pieces
till there's nothing left?
I didn't risk my ass
for the Star path unit.
I came for you.
What's the offer?
Five days.
Big stakes, big danger.
Prepped team, good plan.
You survive and deliver,
I'll give you 200,000.
What would we be stealing?
The quarterly payroll
for an entire Imperial sector.
With the next quarter's
detention estimates
expected to increase
across the Ryloth sector,
any further erosion in local authority
may require an increase
in our black line budget.
And where would you target
these new resources, Supervisor Grandi?
Uh, increase surveillance, sir.
Looking for what?
Anti-Imperial activity as always.
Uh, are you being
intentionally vague?
No, sir.
I'll expect specifics
by the end of the day. Lagret,
what is this item from Arval a-Six?
A positive development, sir.
The dimensions of the conflict
have diminished sufficiently
that mining has resumed
on the occupied lands.
Storage issues
with the displaced?
Ongoing.
As is your unfinished memorandum
of recommendations regarding the problem.
My staff is awaiting an assessment
from Arval a-Six's ministerial director.
Because they've done
such an excellent job so far, hmm?
- What do we do here?
- Sir?
What is our purpose, Lagret?
On Arval a-Six?
I open the question to the room.
What do we do in this building?
Why are we here? Anyone?
We're here to further security objectives
by collecting intelligence,
providing useful analysis, and conducting
effective covert action, sir.
Very good, Dedra.
That is verbatim
from the ISB mission statement, and wrong.
Security is an illusion.
You want security? Call the Navy.
Launch a regiment of troopers.
We are healthcare providers.
We treat sickness.
We identify symptoms.
We locate germs whether they arise
from within or have come from the outside.
The longer we wait to identify a disorder,
the harder it is to treat the disease.
- Do you understand my meaning, Lagret?
- Yes, sir.
Don't trouble yourself
writing the memorandum.
I'll reassign it.
Blevin, Morlana sector.
This incident on Ferrix.
Corporate Security, sir.
They're still in charge out there.
They tried to serve a warrant and ran into
more trouble than they'd anticipated.
Trouble meaning what?
Several dead. Property damage.
Interruption of service.
A stolen Imperial Star path unit
was recovered at the scene.
- Those responsible?
- Unknown, sir.
- I'm heading out after this meeting.
- We'll speak before you leave.
- Jung.
- Sir?
Elaborate on these
added protection requests
for traffic to the Abrion sector.
Proactive measure, sir.
There's an increase in construction
shipments going to Scarif, sir.
Think of a name.
Think of a name for yourself.
Clem.
For the next five days, you'll be Clem.
Who's that?
You'll be working for her.
I thought you were in charge.
I never said that.
She's gonna hate this idea to start.
She's gonna argue with me.
Think it's best you stay inside
until I've had time to work it all out.
Take this.
What is it?
It's a down payment.
It's a Kuati Signet.
Blue kyber. Sky stone.
The ancient world.
Celebrates the uprising
against the Rakatan invaders.
Don't take less than 50,000 for it.
Just know
it will always be worth more to me.
I want it back when this is over.
If I live.
I want it back.
- Against 200,000.
- Giving you my word.
- Hello, Vel.
- We almost didn't get the message.
I'm glad you made it.
They've started patrolling
the old Stone Valley.
It's a full day gettin' out here now.
I like hearing that. The vigilance.
I count on your discipline.
Obviously something's wrong.
No. Actually,
I think things are coming together.
<i>Something I can help you with?</i>
He can pilot. He can shoot. He can lie.
He speaks Alarin, Myo, Nari.
He's got steady nerves
and isn't afraid to kill.
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- He can pilot.
We go in three days!
He increases your chances
of success dramatically.
Now? Like this?
Five months in?
Just plug in some new person?
It'll tear the team apart.
Well, then it's not much of a team, is it?
You're vulnerable and you know it.
I'm buying you critical redundancy.
What do you mean "buying"?
I'm paying him.
No.
Two hundred thousand.
We've been eating roots
and sleeping on rocks for this rebellion
and now you've got
a mercenary on board?
You're wasting energy. You know I'm right.
We need this to work, Vel.
Failure would be devastating.
What would I tell the others?
You'll tell them
it was always a part of the plan.
Are you giving me a choice here?
Yeah.
You take him or call it off.
I was planning to shut you down.
Your odds have improved
since we set the meeting.
You'll take him in
and lie about how it's come to pass.
You'll plug him in as a replacement
for anyone who goes down along the way.
In the next three days,
if for any reason... Look at me!
You wanted to lead?
This is what it comes to.
You got three days.
Something feels off,
something turns, someone starts to fold,
you step up, you lead,
you cancel the mission.
I need to know you understand.
And if he's the problem?
Well, that's the advantage of renting him.
He's disposable.
This has to be a win, Vel.
Yes.
Yes.
Clem!
You will immediately relinquish
any and all com links,
weapons, and scandocs.
You will not return
to your living quarters.
You will leave here and be escorted
with haste to the transfer center,
where you'll be issued
with any personal items
that the Imperial inspectors
have had time to inventory.
You will holo-certify
receipt of said items.
You will holo-certify confirmation
of the official ISB After Action Report
detailing your involvement
and culpability in said Ferrix incident.
- Question, sir.
- No.
And no, you will not waste
further Imperial time reading the reports.
But I've had nothing to do with this.
Well, exactly.
It took the combined ingredients
of idiocy, ineptitude,
and total disengagement
for this farce to have reached
the full apex of incredulous disaster.
Seriously?
My files are filled
with Corporate Security fiascos,
but this takes the prize.
And you, Deputy Inspector Karn.
Proud, are we?
Take solace in this.
You will not be replaced.
You've rung the final bell
on Corporate independence.
As of this morning, the Morlana system
is under permanent Imperial authority.
Congratulations on that.
Is your arm
something I need to worry about?
No.
Well, it's a long walk,
through the night.
Who is he?
You should've asked him that
when you had the chance.
He told me you were the boss
and you wouldn't like my being here.
That's about all I know.
He is something we will never discuss.
When we get to camp,
we're going to tell them
this was my idea
and we've been planning it all the while.
We never mention him.
If you change that in any way,
you and I are going to have a big problem.
And why so far?
We're robbing the armory
at the Aldhani Garrison.
There's an Imperial airfield nearby,
and they've got nothing better to do
than patrol.
So, this is the safe route.
He told me about the payroll,
not the garrison!
I don't know who you're talking about.
You're taking on an Imperial armory?
Are you not joining us?
Us? How many of us are there?
Now we are seven.
Seven?
Seven against a garrison?
Save your wind. This is a long walk.
Hey, hold on. Hold on.
Get down! Tuck in!
They won't be back today.
Come on.
This says five dead.
One local
and four Pre-Mor security employees.
Uh, they've misspelt Ferrix.
Where is my Star path unit?
Where are you?
He said it in the meeting.
It's got to be here.
There's a raw transmission
in here somewhere.
Hang on.
"Varnisi. Unauthorized Imperial equipment,
Ferrix, 0430.
"Ensign retrieved a sealed Imperial
NS-9 Star path unit from the site."
That is our box from Steergard.
Has to be.
Right, that gives us jurisdiction.
I want you to go to Blevin's office,
tell them we need
everything they've got on Ferrix.
It might mean more if you went.
I don't want to spark his interest.
<i>Orbiting Coruscant.</i>
Your controls.
Landing protocol 037.
<i>Protocol 037.</i>
What is this place?
Nothing special.
There used to be hundreds
of settlements up here.
Forty thousand Aldhanis
all across the highlands.
They were here for centuries,
but it only took the Empire
a decade to clear them out.
- Killed them?
- No.
Drove them south.
There's an Enterprise Zone
in the Lowlands.
Factories, new towns, Imperial housing.
Aldhani has the unfortunate quality
of being close to nothing
and not very far away from everything.
It's the perfect hub for distribution.
If one were trying
to take over the galaxy.
So, who are we supposed to be?
There's still
a few shepherds in the hills.
Nature lovers, mystics, dead-enders.
Drink up. We've a way to go.
My assistant tells me
you refused to turn over the file
on this incident in Ferrix.
I have work to do.
That was an official request
made by an officer of my staff.
I suggest you schedule an appointment.
I want the full Ferrix report.
It's my sector.
An Imperial Star path unit was stolen
from the Steergard Naval Yard
and found at the scene.
That gives me jurisdictional access.
You've been here, what, just over a year?
You might want to steady the ladder
before you start climbing.
I'm not looking for career advice.
You fall here, you fall alone.
Are you denying my request?
For the second time today.
Fine. I'll take it to Major Partagaz.
Don't look down.
Everyone's dead.
While you were sleeping,
they came in, slit everybody's throat.
You ride with Mossy, Garvish?
Saw Gerrera?
Fall asleep on watch, they're gonna put
your head on a pike for a laugh.
Sorry.
Don't tell Vel.
I won't.
You will.
You better think what you're gonna say
'cause she's coming down now.
Actually...
...there's two.
What do you make of that?
We better make sure
they know what's comin'.
Who is it?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
What's she doing?
Gather up.
This is Clem.
Haven't mentioned him before now
because I wasn't sure
we could get him here on time.
We've had a stroke of luck.
He's been able to fight his way free.
He'll give us critical redundancy
in all areas.
It's a bit late for surprises.
That's Skeen.
This is Taramyn.
Nemik.
And Cinta.
We've always known we were short a man.
Can I speak with you?
Let's get Clem settled in.
Good to have you, Clem.
We'll take all the help we can get.
Cinta, feed him
and then take a look at his arm.
- Vel.
- The posts on the corral are down again.
Now, unless you two want to be
chasin' animals all day,
I'd get out there now. Okay?
Let's get to it.
We'll work Clem into the program at drill.
<i>Telgordo Travel service to Hosnian Prime,</i>
<i>Plexis, and Eufornis Major</i>
<i>will now be departing
from platforms 7-12 and 7-13.</i>
<i>Do not join the line
without your boarding pass.</i>
Mother.
What are you starin' at?
Blaster burn.
Needs to be cleaned.
Apologies in advance.
We're trying to save our pain meds.
- How do you know him?
- He comes highly recommended.
- So you don't know him.
- I know that we need him.
That's all I'll say.
Anything else is a violation of security.
No, he's got brass.
You... You can feel it.
And we can use a hand,
but this late in the game?
- As opposed to when?
- You trust him with our lives?
That's my call to make.
He's committed.
I'm feeling that.
I want to.
Feel what?
His belief in the cause.
When it comes down to it,
that's all I need to know.
Vel.
- Vel!
- I trust him.
Okay?
All right?
Senator Mon Mothma's here.
New driver.
Anyone we know?
Never seen him.
Chandrilan?
One would think.
Senator.
- What a pleasure to see you.
- You as well, Luthen.
Sorry to be so late.
It's always right when you're leaving,
everyone remembers things
they're meant to bother you with.
Free your mind, Senator.
This is a place where time stands still.
It's hard being surrounded
with this much history
and not be humbled by the insignificance
of our daily anxieties.
How true.
And how I need to hear that.
- You know Kleya.
- Of course.
We often refer to the gallery
as Coruscant's unofficial
temple of patience.
Well, I have to start
coming here more often.
You're teasing us.
So, a gift for your husband.
Yes. It's his Day of Days.
It's a Chandrilan custom.
One of our many.
Yours is a rich history.
Well, that's a kind way of putting it.
I put aside a few things.
If I recall,
he has an interest in military artifacts.
Yes.
So,
let's start with the oldest one.
It's a Utapaun monk cudgel.
You see the ceremonial variety
in many places,
but this is the real thing.
It's a unique gift for most, but...
it's a treasure for the true aficionado.
Dated to the eighth archaic settlem...
May I show you something?
Oh, don't bother.
I couldn't afford anything here.
Please. There's no harm in looking.
We just got in
some terribly interesting coins.
Yeah.
I'm trying to expand Perrin's tastes
beyond fighting implements.
Is there anything else
that might interest him?
Well, your timing is excellent.
I have something very special
that just came in.
Come with me.
It's a two-faced divinity.
Fourteen thousand years old.
A sun goddess and a serpent
from the over world
sharing the same mouth.
If you can't deliver,
I need to know.
- Do you think I'm not trying?
- I never think that.
But I need to start planning
if you're no longer coming through.
The money's there.
It's just getting very dangerous
to move it around.
I can't pull funds the way I used to.
- They're watching me now.
- Oh, they're watching everyone.
This is different. They're everywhere.
There's a new spy every day at the Senate.
I visit the bank, they're all new faces.
You got a new driver.
I feel under siege.
I have many mouths to feed.
I can only forage for so long.
I found someone I think can help me.
Someone who?
To bring into the circle? No.
- I know what I'm asking.
- No.
We're vulnerable enough.
We need funding, not more people.
Don't lecture me on vulnerability.
No one's more at risk than I am.
You think I haven't thought this through?
I'd be the first one to fall.
Why don't you take this on loan?
May I?
If your husband doesn't love it,
I'll be glad to take it back.
It's a daring choice,
but I trust you'll have the courage
to turn back
if it should be a bit much.
I appreciate that.
You'll be here?
Well, if not, Kleya can always reach me.
Kleya, can we have this wrapped
for the Senator?
He's with us.
Stay.
No, I didn't.
What the hell is going on?
When did this happen?
What, he's here now? Where?
- Getting cleaned up.
- And we've no say in this?
- It's not a vote.
- Just like that?
It's been in the works.
- What else don't I know about?
- This helps us.
You were cutting it close.
You said it yourself.
Three days out.
What were you gonna do
if I couldn't get here today?
Turn up with an extra face to explain?
I knew you'd come through.
We're not prepped for this.
We don't even have enough comms as it is.
- We have two spares.
- That was our backup.
Clem is our backup.
We have an extra uniform.
Gonna need to leave us
your belt and gloves.
Clem.
We need another hand, and you know it.
I should've been consulted.
On that, we agree.
Clem, this is Lieutenant Gorn.
- He's our contact at the garrison.
- Wounded on top of it.
On top of what?
Being someone I've never met
who's suddenly got my neck in their hands.
I know the feeling.
- Are we done?
- Who is he?
He's Clem.
He's here, that's all that matters.
Look, we're wasting daylight.
Let's get on with it.
Give Nemik a hand.
What's with all the patrols
on Stone Canyon?
There's an Imperial engineer
arriving from Coruscant.
We're mapping the old trail for him.
But that'll stop tomorrow.
I'm pushing all our attention
toward the Lowlands.
How long do we have you?
I've got a midnight inspection.
Let's get going.
What's all this?
- Dinner for the governor.
- What governor?
The governor of Hanna.
My regimental mate, that governor.
That's tonight?
It's on your calendar.
I added it a month ago
after we discussed it.
You don't remember?
I remember you wearing me down.
I didn't think anyone could do that.
Are you enjoying this?
No. Just looking forward
to seeing some old friends.
Oh, who else is coming?
Seating chart's just there.
Ars Dangor? Sly Moore?
From the Vizier's private chamber?
Is that a problem?
You can't be serious.
These people hate me.
They spend every day
trying to undo anything I've touched.
Well, perhaps tomorrow
they'll think twice.
Uh, not right now, please.
Go!
You shouldn't have invited them
without making sure I was aware.
Well, it's a bit late to cancel.
But at your pleasure.
Well played, Perrin.
And no, I'm not being serious.
Don't seat them near me.
Oh, I've taken care of that.
You're at the boring end of the table.
These people are fun.
Oh, are they? Are they fun?
We should find
some Ghorman guests for tonight
and see how amused they are.
Your fun friends just cut off
their shipping lanes yesterday.
Do you know how many will starve?
Oh, perhaps we can laugh about it
over the third course.
Perhaps you should have a rest.
If you make me pay attention, I will.
And you won't be happy.
Don't do this again.
There's rumor
you bought me a present.
It's going back.
Must everything be boring and sad?
Akti Amaugh, the Valley of Caves.
The sacred valley.
The Empire came in 13 years ago
and liberated the air base, Alkenzi,
50 klicks west of here.
They quickly discovered the unique
storage possibilities of the caverns,
claimed the land for the Emperor,
and dammed up Nasma Klain,
the sacred river.
Now, the Aldhani Garrison
is a depot for supplies, weapons,
and the payroll
for the entire Imperial sector.
Garrison, observation tower,
sentry defenses,
all to protect this runway opening here.
I'll do it. It's fragile, that piece.
The rain gets into the glue.
The runway descends
underground to the flight deck
of a single Max-7 Rono freighter.
Vel said you could pilot.
Fly a Rono?
A box freighter?
Mmm, it's not really flying, but yeah.
This room behind the flight deck,
that's a vault.
We're taking crates of payroll
from that room,
loading the freighter,
and escaping out of the runway tunnel.
- Obviously, it's not to scale.
- Escaping?
- In a Rono?
- Yeah.
Those were TIE fighters
we saw on the way in.
- How far is the air base?
- From the garrison...
- Fifty klicks, you said.
- Fifty-two.
Fine, 52.
They'll be on you in minutes.
Nine minutes. We've timed it.
- Mmm.
- Okay.
You'll be lucky to make the horizon.
It's a suicide run.
Exactly.
That's why they only keep
a 40-man regiment in the garrison.
Because they know
no one's stupid enough to try it.
No one but us.
These old stones, Nasma Brani,
it's a temple or what's left of it
that once sat on the mighty river.
Lieutenant Gorn, you tell it.
Once every three years
for as long as anyone can remember,
the Aldhanis gather in this valley
for a celestial event
they call <i>Mak-ani bray Dhani.</i>
The Eye of Aldhani. Thousands of them.
They'd hike for weeks to get here
just to see it from the sacred land.
- To see what?
- Imagine 50 meteor showers all at once,
but like a curtain
being pulled across the sky
until the Eye, the window to the galaxy,
forms over the horizon.
You've seen this?
I've been here almost seven years.
I've seen it twice.
It's not the event it used to be.
Now they've got everyone relocated,
it's a pretty sad affair,
but the Eye,
it's not something you'll soon forget.
Once every three years.
To a thousandth of a second.
And it's not really a meteor shower.
It's a recurrent band of crystalized,
noctilucent microdensities.
Billions of crystals.
Very heavy but small and unstable.
As the planet passes through the belt,
they swarm the atmosphere,
heat up, and explode.
From the ground, it's a thing of beauty.
In the sky, it's chaos.
We've calculated an escape trajectory
that gets us out
just before the Eye closes.
This happens in three days' time.
That's your cover.
Yes.
Gets us in, gets us out.
They won't know where we came from,
and if we can beat the clock,
we'll be gone
before they even know what happened.
Now, you've got a lot to learn
and very little time to do it,
so what we need to know is,
are you in all the way?
Let's get to it.
Speak.
She's demanding the raw data
from the incident on Ferrix.
The Star path unit
that was recovered at the scene
has been traced to a theft
at an air base under my jurisdiction, sir.
She's overreaching
to increase the size of her portfolio.
She should spend more time
on the security at her bases
- and less furthering her career.
- Lieutenant Meero.
The stolen item has great value,
sir, particularly to the rebels.
Tracing its theft
might expose activity in my sector.
People also take things for money,
do they not?
Is it worth creating
this much intra-office friction
in the pursuit of what seems like
a case of a robbery gone awry?
Sir, it is my feeling
that this is part of an ongoing effort
to steal proprietary Imperial equipment
in anticipation of an organized rebellion.
I have three
previous case files on my desk
that begin to suggest a pattern.
Your feeling.
I'm seeing signs of coordinated activity
over a number of sectors.
What activity?
Similar items of interest,
repeated methods.
- Gut instinct.
- You came to us from enforcement.
Yes, sir.
Here, we act on vetted
and verified information.
Alert me when this materializes
into something more definite.
Until then,
confine future activities to your sectors.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
You have two sectors to supervise.
Blevin is handling six.
He does, I will admit,
hew to the traditional viewpoint
of this office and its staffing.
He is, I'm sure, a challenge to work with.
His quarterly reports, however, are in
and yours are not,
and here we are spending
your valuable time with this issue.
There's a high bar
for your performance, Lieutenant.
Unfair perhaps,
but senseless to ignore
and potentially the foundation
of a uniquely superior career.
You're supposed to be
more competent and tucked away.
That's why you're here.
That's why we're bringing in
officers like you.
Let's remind everyone of that
and not get lost in the dust.
Yes, sir.
On a positive note, I was impressed
with your detention numbers from Sev Tok.
Far above the quota.
I may be sending more
of that sort of work your way.
- Thank you, sir.
- We're done.
Know how to use this?
Yeah.
That's the Rono freighter specs
and the console layout.
You get done with that,
that's a detailed map of the garrison.
That's an Aldhani phrase book.
Can I eat my food?
You'll eat,
you'll let Cinta check the bandage,
and you'll have learned all that
by morning.
I'll take the first watch.

(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
Wouldn't you rather give it all at once
to something real?
What would we be stealing?
The quarterly payroll
for an entire Imperial sector.
PARTAGAZ: Blevin, this incident on Ferrix.
Corporate Security, sir.
They're still in charge out there.
A stolen Imperial Star path unit
was recovered at the scene.
VEL: <i>Five months in?</i>
Just plug in some new person?
It'll tear the team apart.
I'm buying you critical redundancy.
- What do you mean "buying"?
- I'm paying him.
We've been eating roots
and sleeping on rocks for this rebellion
and now you've got a mercenary on board?
LUTHEN: <i>Take him or call it off.</i>
- You're taking on an Imperial armory?
- Are you not joining us?
CASSIAN: <i>Us? How many of us are there?</i>
VEL: <i>Now we are seven.</i>
That's Skeen.
Taramyn.
Nemik.
- Cinta. And Lieutenant Gorn.
- Who is he?
He's Clem.
He's here. That's all that matters.
We're wasting daylight.
Let's get on with it.
As of this morning, the Morlana system
is under permanent Imperial authority.
<i>Congratulations on that.</i>
Mother.
Senator.
- If you can't deliver, I need to know.
- The money's there.
It's just getting very dangerous
to move it around.
You think I haven't thought this through?
I'd be the first one to fall.
VEL: That's a vault.
We're taking crates of payroll
from that room,
loading the freighter,
and escaping out of the runway tunnel.
What we need to know is,
are you in all the way?
Let's get to it.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
EEDY: Syril.
You're slouching.
Is that how you've been
presenting yourself to the world?
It would explain a great deal.
Being a leader
isn't something one just turns on and off.
By the time you've remembered
to sit up straight, it's too late.
You might as well wear a sign that says,
"I promise to disappoint you."
Shame we couldn't have seen more
of each other when you were flourishing.
I'd have the memory to sustain me.
Well, you could've come
any time you wanted.
Any civilized being knows an open
invitation is no invitation at all.
My assumption is,
you have no prospect for the future.
I had a spare room.
(SIGHS)
Could've visited any time you wanted.
- You know that.
- I know what you tell me.
I intuit the rest.
I intuit you have no future prospects.
I'd forgotten the precision
of your predictive powers.
- Ah, you've remembered how to mock me.
- Forgotten how sensitive you can be.
Perhaps you've forgotten my question.
Do you have even
a single prospect before you?
I'll find a way.
I'm calling Uncle Harlo.
- (SIGHS)
- I'm calling in the family favor.
Haven't heard that in a while.
These are desperate times.
- You're assuming he'll remember you.
- That's amusing.
And you think he'll talk to you?
I know he will.
And he'll know why I called.
And he'll respect me
for having waited so long in asking
and being so prudent about my request.
(SCOFFS) What is it you'll be asking for?
Someone who will take you on, Syril.
Setting the bar high, are we?
Uncle Harlo will know what's best.
- (BREATHING HEAVILY)
- (LIVESTOCK BLEATING)
(GASPS)
(GROANS)
(GASPS)
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
(SKEEN SNIFFLES)
It's all there.
Vel asked me to have a look.
(SIGHS) I think
she's having second thoughts.
Go talk to her if you want.
She'll be up soon.
You didn't come with much.
That plus the bad arm?
It's pretty clear
you left wherever you were in a hurry.
Corporate issue. Interesting.
There's no sense bein' upset.
You're lucky to be alive right now.
We've been down here for months,
and the stakes are high.
- How's your arm?
- I'll be fine.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, who... whose is this?
Didn't get a name.
Oh.
You know what this means, don't you?
Yeah, I saw your eyes go right to it.
Krayt Head.
See, they don't know.
They got no idea.
What about this?
"By The Hand."
So, where were you?
Sipo.
Youth center.
Three years. I was 13 when I went in.
I never heard of it.
- Well, you didn't miss anything.
- Yeah.
They've built a lot of cages, huh?
"The axe forgets, but the tree remembers."
Now it's our turn to do the chopping.
So, that's it?
That's why you're here?
Revenge?
Yeah, that's good enough for now.
You?
I was told I could help.
Yeah, but you won't say by who.
Working with other people is never easy.
Yeah.
I didn't mark you for a team player.
It always breaks at the weakest point.
Oh, you're worried about the kids.
Nemik's a surprise.
He's green, but he's all in.
He's a true believer.
Nothing but the cause for him.
Then there's Cinta.
Cinta Kaz.
She's stone cold and fearless.
Probably the toughest one here.
She's already sharin' a blanket,
if that's what you're wonderin'.
(SCOFFS)
And the Lieutenant?
Without him, there's no plan.
He could be walking us right into a trap.
They would've taken us down by now.
Or maybe that's what you're here for.
I'm here to win and walk away.
Wouldn't that be lovely?
PERRIN: The driver's here.
MON: Kloris.
Yes.
You know his name.
Is Leida ready?
I'm not sure.
Where is she? Leida?
Hmm. Did you eat?
When would that have happened?
I just came down.
MON: Take something for the ride.
- What?
- MON: We need to be going.
Oh. Change in plan.
Dad's taking me.
You're taking me, right?
Got to clear it with her.
I don't have early class today.
- We planned this.
- You did.
Get your coat. It's not up for discussion.
Are you serious?
MON: Am I serious?
Just go. You're off the hook.
Enjoying this?
Get your coat.
It's out of your way anyway,
so what's the point?
The point is, we have a schedule,
the driver's waiting,
- I've planned on this, and we're going.
- You're only doing it to show off.
- What?
- Just go.
What would I be showing off?
That you're involved somehow.
What? That's just...
Nobody cares. You can relax.
That's just so hurtful.
- See? There you go.
- Go where?
That's my point.
It's all about you, isn't it?
It's always all about you.
Is this really
how you'd like to start the day?
I didn't choose this conversation.
(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)
I so appreciate the support.
Dray milk.
You can live on it.
You may question your existence
after a few days, but...
(SNIFFLES)
(GROANS)
Memorable, isn't it?
(DEVICE CLICKING)
That's an old one.
Old and true.
And sturdy.
One of the best
navigational tools ever built.
Can't be jammed or intercepted.
Something breaks, you can fix it yourself.
Hard to learn.
Yes, but once you've mastered it,
you're free.
We've grown reliant on Imperial tech,
and we've made ourselves vulnerable.
There's a growing list
of things we've known and forgotten,
things they've pushed us to forget.
Things like freedom.
Nemik sees oppression everywhere.
Skeen pretends not to listen,
but I know the message is sinking in.
(CHUCKLES)
He's writin' a manifesto.
Did he tell you?
Apparently, the only thing keepin' us
from liberty is a few more ideas.
Few more ideas. (CHUCKLES)
It's so confusing, isn't it?
So much going wrong, so much to say,
and all of it happening so quickly.
The pace of repression
outstrips our ability to understand it.
And that is the real trick
of the Imperial thought machine.
It's easier to hide behind
40 atrocities than a single incident.
But they have a fight on their hands,
don't they?
Our elemental rights
are such a simple thing to hold,
they will have to shake the galaxy hard
to loosen our grip.
I'd like to hear what Clem believes.
I know what I'm against.
Everything else will have to wait.
- You're my ideal reader.
- (SKEEN SCOFFS)
- Now you've done it.
- Haven't titled it yet. I've been waiting.
It's a work in progress, and I know
that there's a great deal left to say.
I mean, look.
Right here.
Fresh inspiration.
Two seemingly random objects,
and yet this charts an astral path,
this maps the trail
of political consciousness.
Both systems based on truth,
both navigating toward clear
and achievable outcomes.
- Basic facts expanded to...
- TARAMYN: Clem.
To be continued.
(CHUCKLES)
Busy day, Clem. Finish your milk.
(SCOFFS)
- You don't trust him?
- (SIGHS)
- I barely trust you.
- Hmm.
VEL: Obviously, it's a track launch,
so there's an adjusted thrust ratio
to make it up the ramp.
- CASSIAN: Okay.
- It's on an overhead rail.
- Has to be, yeah.
- So calibrating the weight...
- What about it?
- How would you do it?
How would I know the weight?
Is this a test?
It's a simple question.
You don't know
how to get it off the runway, do you?
We know how to fly it.
CASSIAN: Yeah, but you've
got to get it up there first.
Answer the question. (SIGHS)
You really don't.
Do you?
You don't know how to get it out of there.
How do you input the weight?
(SCOFFS)
- You sure it's on the rail?
- Yes.
It's mounted?
It's ready to go?
That's how they keep it,
you're sure of that?
Yes, we're sure.
(SCOFFS)
Lieutenant Gorn is in there every day.
Okay.
There's a load clutch.
It... It's a big ugly handle
just right next to the booster throttle.
There's a gauge just below
to read out the weight.
TARAMYN: Why isn't this in the manual?
Because it's a custom job.
It's an add-on.
(SCOFFING) What were you gonna do
if I wasn't here?
(SIGHS) Might have been ugly
but we'd have figured it out.
(STAMMERS) We wanted to be sure.
- Oh. Okay. I'll pilot.
- VEL: No, you'll do as you're told.
Ah, I'm flying it.
We can say it's your idea. I don't care.
But if it's my ass on the line,
I'm pulling this thing out of there.
(SIGHS)
- Okay.
- Okay.
(SNORTS)
(LIVESTOCK BLEATING)
TARAMYN: Clem.
The tower yard.
The dam.
The garrison HQ
and the barracks up top by the east end.
The Rono tunnel.
The flight control tower.
And objective number one,
the door at the base of the tower.
The Temple Path.
Now, the real thing has a downhill pitch,
but the distance is right.
And down there,
where we'll be coming from,
The Old Temple.
Got it.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
LIEUTENANT GORN: What's this?
Target practice?
(CLANKING)
(SIGHS)
Where are they?
This was to be cleaned up yesterday.
- Where are they?
- They should be back soon, sir.
LIEUTENANT GORN: Back from where?
I believe they're in the tower, sir.
The Commandant's wife needed help
moving furniture for the dinner.
I'll be back in an hour.
This had better be well on its way,
or I promise you,
I'll be revisiting
the schedule for winter furloughs.
You are Imperial Private Clem.
You're a sentry from the Alkenzi Airbase
transferred for special duty.
Shoulders back.
- More.
- Don't touch me.
You want something, you tell me.
Can you walk like a soldier?
I've seen it done.
Let's find out
if you've been payin' attention.
Form up.
(BUSY CHATTER)
TIGO: I don't care where it goes.
Just get it out of here.
SOLDIER: Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Captain Tigo!
There you are.
They're still clearing out some guests.
What do you think?
As a hotel?
Do you want it or not?
The assignment?
No, you're taking the assignment.
I was asking if this would do
as your headquarters.
Could I be made Prefect?
The title.
I know it doesn't come with extra pay.
You can wear a ball gown if you'd like.
Just get this up and running
before my next staff meeting.
TARAMYN: It's about confidence.
We belong here.
We're followin' orders.
The door's bein' opened as we approach.
Lieutenant Gorn will be out front.
He's the leader.
He's the gatekeeper.
So eyes on him at all times.
We're locked in. We're listenin'.
We're ready to adapt.
And last man in bolts the door behind him.
Squad, halt.
Questions?
What are they doing?
Never mind about them.
You got enough to worry about.
Let's walk it again at speed.
You should switch.
What?
He's left-handed.
Should swap sides.
Why don't you get a handle
on what we're doing here
before you start making suggestions.
VEL: Why?
Why switch sides?
Skeen is left-handed.
You want your weapon on the outside.
- What am I?
- Right-handed.
VEL: Taramyn?
- Right.
- VEL: Cinta?
CASSIAN: Right.
Nemik?
Favors right, but shoots left.
Fine.
Let's switch.
Any other suggestions?
(WHIRRING IN DISTANCE)
Wait!
(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)
Cover the guns.
(ALL PANTING)
TARAMYN: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
(WHOOSHING)
- He's gone.
- VEL: I don't think so.
(WHIRRING)
- (LOUD WHOOSHING)
- (ALL GASP)
(LIVESTOCK BLEATING)
They'll soon see.
Surprise from above
is never as shocking as one from below.
(LOUD WHOOSHING)
Corporal Kimzi.
Sir.
Enjoying the view?
Yes, sir.
Gets a bit stale in there sometimes.
(SIGHS)
It's always inspiring, isn't it?
KIMZI: I suppose.
Is it true they're tearing this all down?
It's been discussed.
Move the airbase here?
That makes sense.
It's a big project.
Not too many Dhanis
to worry about anymore though, eh?
How many do you think we'll have tomorrow?
I don't know.
It was less than a hundred last time.
Still enough to smell 'em, right?
Can you imagine this place
with a couple of thousand of them?
Yes.
I can.
Get about your business, Corporal.
I'll be making rounds tomorrow night,
and I expect you at your station.
Sir. Yes, sir.
(BOTH PANTING)
(BOTH STRAINING)

It's hard.
<i>Naych.</i>
How's your arm?
It's good. You're a healer.
Hey! What are you doing?
I'm just moving your stuff.
- Don't.
- (GRUNTS) It was in the way.
Don't ever.
I thought you were checking the comms.
(SIGHS)
Hey.
And you can dress yourself.
NEMIK: Who packed these charges?
CINTA: That would be me.
VEL: I can fit three more in here.
TARAMYN: Let's have a look at you.
Make a soldier of you yet.
BLEVIN:
So, I'll want weekly reports from Ferrix.
And I want to keep
a tight hand on the budget.
Now, what did I miss while I was gone?
WOMAN: The Finkly Conference.
They have agreed to move up your speech...
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
DEDRA: <i>Hosnian Prime?</i>
HEERT: <i>It's useless.</i>
They haven't broken,
misplaced, or mislabeled
a single military component
in the past 12 quarters.
Well, maybe there's, uh,
an unofficial ledger.
I... I wouldn't trust
anything coming out of there.
Imperial Navy is the only account
they have left at this point,
and they'd never admit anything's wrong.
You should go.
I didn't realize how late it was.
I'm staying if you are.
(SIGHS) I don't know what I'm doing.
About any of it.
Yes, you do.
You're onto something.
Kessel, Fondor,
targeting consoles from Jakku,
proton warheads from Base Cay,
the Steergard Star path.
He's right though.
It's too spread out to be organized.
But you don't believe that.
I know this.
If I was them, this is how I'd do it.
I'd spread it out.
Never climb the same fence twice.
It's too random to be random.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Two more files each?
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
(CRACKLING)
Stay focused, Clem.
(SNIFFLES)
To the Rebellion.
NEMIK: To the Rebellion.

EEDY: I needn't tell you how wrong
you were about Uncle Harlo.
But you will.
He said he never felt police work
was your chosen path.
SYRIL: 'Cause he knows me so well.
And whose fault is that?
Can I guess?
Perhaps you'll study Uncle Harlo
with more energy in the future.
What field is it
he thinks I should be pursuing?
He said he wanted to think about it.
I struggled with how best to describe
to him the events that have led us here.
I told him how sorry you were
about what happened.
I stressed that it was a large enough
mistake to be deeply educational.
Yes, I heard some of that.
Our conversation?
Your side of it.
Hard to miss.
Sadly, I wasn't able
to study Uncle Harlo's response.
He knows how much we're counting on him.
- VEL: Stairs to the hangar?
- (ALL PANTING)
CASSIAN: Four flights, four landings.
VEL: Vault cage weak point?

Clear signal?
My turn.
Lieutenant Gorn.
What's an Imperial lieutenant doing
getting involved with this?
What difference does it make?
Everyone else seems to know.
He fell in love with a local woman
and lost a promotion.
Then he lost the woman.
Then he lost his taste for the Empire.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Everyone has their own rebellion.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

MAN: Is the shipment secure, sir?
LIEUTENANT GORN: Attention!
BOTH: Sir.
LIEUTENANT GORN: As you were.
I prepared
a reduced schedule for tomorrow.
- I know you were eager for that.
- It'll mean a great deal to the men.
And now,
I see the gantry's still unpainted.
I've spoken to them about it, sir.
LIEUTENANT GORN: And yet it remains undone
with an engineering officer from Coruscant
arriving today and in our business.
Let's see if painting it tomorrow night
will make the point more clearly.
KIMZI: Sir.
May I speak plainly, sir?
Plainly and quickly.
Aldhani, sir.
It's not many people's
first-choice assignment.
The thing you hear when posted to Aldhani
is that perhaps you'll be lucky enough
to be there for the Eye.
The idea of being this close
and not seeing it,
and I know we can't all be up there,
but I fear morale might be crushed
by having anything more
than an essential roster
down here tomorrow night.
(SNIFFLES)
I want it painted the day after tomorrow.
I'll be here midday,
and I expect to see it shine.
- Absolutely, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
Make sure the men know
how close they've come.
(SIGHS)
(SIGHS)
- (GRUNTS)
- Don't move.
- 'Cause you know what'll happen.
- Hey, what are you doing?
There we go.
I knew it.
I knew you were lying. I knew it.
- Look.
- What is it?
SKEEN: Kyber.
Sky kyber.
He's been hiding it.
Skeen?
- Sky kyber. Look at it glow.
- What's going on?
I warned you.
He comes here with nothin'
but the clothes on his back
and a stone worth 30,000 credits?
- You have a problem, you come to me.
- Here I am.
I've topped out on questions, Vel.
I have reached my limit.
He won't say why he's here,
where he's from.
He doesn't say what he believes in.
And now this?
Who brings a treasure to a robbery?
We don't have time for this.
I need to know who I'm riding with.
You know exactly who I am.
- And you know I'll kill you for it.
- Okay.
Okay, so, I guess we know
it's not a fake, huh?
- CASSIAN: It's your call.
- Let's not go too far, Clem.
- I just want what's mine.
- Yeah, don't put me on the spot.
Enough!
Everyone stands down.
Everyone!
NEMIK: There's something coming!
There's a... There's a ship in the valley!
VEL: Get your packs up.
Move!
Put the weapon away.
Give him the stone.
You can kill each other later.
You'd be right where I am.
Tell yourself whatever you want.
NEMIK: I think we're okay!
It's heading towards the garrison!
Get your stuff! Move!
(SHIP WHOOSHING IN DISTANCE)
VEL: We'll talk when we're safe.
I'm being paid.
Paid to be here.
You need to know?
That's it.
- What?
- Yeah, I'm here for the money.
You can't live with that?
I'm not worth it?
I'll walk away and wish you luck.
But that's what it is.
(SCOFFS)
I don't want to walk in
looking over my shoulder.
You knew this?
The choice was take him or call it off.
- Call it off?
- You should've told us days ago.
Maybe so.
It just would've been something else.
What's that mean?
The day before is always hard.
Too much time to worry.
TARAMYN: You think we're scared?
I know you are.
It's really only the money?
To take a risk like this?
Come on.
Maybe you're the one that's afraid.
CASSIAN: Of course I'm afraid.
But there's a difference
between fear and losing your nerve.
You want out of this?
Make a choice.
Don't use me as an excuse.
Cinta?
No.
She didn't tell me.
Let's get to the camp in one piece.
You can all chew on it there.
All of you.
Move.
(SNIFFLES)
(PERRIN SIGHS)
You saw me talking to Gar Ta feed.
Mmm. You were busy tonight.
He knows more about
what you're up to than I do.
- Must be embarrassing.
- (SCOFFS)
When were you planning to tell me
about this new foundation?
Well, I didn't think you'd be interested.
Why is that?
It's charitable.
Hmm.
What's his name?
Kloris.
- PERRIN: Kloris?
- Sir?
<i>Would you mind taking the Expressway?</i>
KLORIS: Yes, sir.
(ALL PANTING)
Looks just like your model.
Should do.
I've had plenty of time to study,
and we've been
sneaking up here for months.
VEL: We need to signal soon.
Let's get a fire up. Let's go.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
(DEVICE CLICKS, WHIRRING)
VEL: Okay, that should do it.
Skeen.
(CLEARS THROAT)
(SNIFFLING)
She wants me to tell you about my brother.
There's a long version,
but what matters is they killed him.
He was a farmer.
Imperial Prefect came in,
took his land, flooded it.
He couldn't fight him.
He couldn't bear it, so he went a boat
and filled his pockets with stones.
I always hated the Empire.
I don't really know
what to call how I feel now.
What kind of farm?
Trees.
Pepper trees.
Centuries of 'em.
That's as close to an apology
as you're gonna get.
(CHUCKLES)
It's close enough.
Taramyn's in charge now.
Completely in charge.
I need to know you understand that.
Where will you be?
If all goes well,
we'll see you tomorrow night.
I need to hear you tell me
you can follow the plan.
You won't have a problem with me.
Good luck to you.
VEL: No farewells tonight.
Plenty of work to do together tomorrow.
(GRUNTING, PANTING)
(SIGHS)
(STATIC)
(STATIC, INDISTINCT CHATTER)
I thought you were turning it off.
I was just going to.
You said that an hour ago.
Am I keeping you up?
(SIGHS)
There's nothing coming through tonight.
You want to be useful,
go clean some coins.
(BUZZES)
Happy?
Have you checked your walk-away pack?
- Yes.
- And the one on the Fondor?
I don't like seeing you nervous.
There's nothing else you can do, Luthen.
They're either gonna be okay out there
or they're not.
Well, that's a daring prediction.
- Vel's the only one who traces back.
- No.
The thief. And or.
I wasn't careful.
You wanted this to happen.
This is what it took.
It's never gonna be perfect.
I wanted it too much.
We have clients in the morning.
Yeah, I'll be ready.
It'll all be over this time tomorrow.
Or it'll just be starting.
Or that.
(CLICKS)
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

Something's wrong on Two.
Something's really wrong on Two.
Look at me.
It takes a week for one word
to get all the way up here.
You're panicking about something
that's happening
on the other side of the building!
You think they're listening?
Like you would know.
I know this.
They don't need to care.
All they need to do
is turn this floor on twice a day
and keep their numbers rolling.
<i>I need a loan.</i>
You have someone in mind.
It's not a long list.
And yet you're afraid to say who it is.
Davo Sculdun.
He is not a banker.
He's a thug.
Your breathing sounds weak.
The doctor was here yesterday.
You really don't know where he is?
New man on the floor!
Hold your positions!
I have a new idea.
<i>Anto Kreegyr.</i>
- I want you to meet him.
- Anto Kreegyr?
He's been probing
the Imperial power station at Spellhaus.
We've got a rebel pilot in custody.
One of Anto Kreegyr's group.
We don't think Kreegyr knows
he's gone missing yet.
What if we foul the ship?
Have the pilot found dead in the cockpit.
Make it so.
Top priority. Quickly and carefully.
We leave no trace.
- What, you can't save him?
- There's nothing to save.
He's had a massive stroke.
What happened down on Two?
A man who was just released on Four
ended up back on Two the next day.
Word got out on the floor,
and then they killed them all.
No one's getting out, are they?
Not now.
Not after this.
We need to go tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- You heard me.
Go where?
Anywhere.
It has to be tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.
- We can't wait.
We'll never have a better chance.
- You sound insane.
- No, listen to me.
They don't have enough guards,
and they know it.
They're afraid. Right now, they're afraid.
Afraid? Afraid of what?
They just killed a hundred men
to keep them quiet.
- What would you call that?
- I'd call that power.
Power? Power doesn't panic.
Five thousand men are about to find out
they're never leaving here alive.
Don't you think
that worries them upstairs?
Whatever we're making here,
it's clearly something they need.
They can't afford to be surprised again.
There'll never be less guards
than tomorrow. You know that.
On-Program.
Everyday we wait, they get stronger.
- It might be wise to have a plan.
- We have a plan.
Oh, what? You and Birnok and Melshi?
You don't have time to be stupid!
Come on!
The plan works around
the new man coming down.
They'll replace Ulaf tomorrow.
That might not happen again
until it's too late.
I'd rather die trying to take them down
than die giving them what they want.
We won't have a better chance.
It has to be tomorrow.
Program.
<i>Home Blue,
proceed directly to your cell.</i>
Keef, where is he?
He's dead.
He didn't make it?
What happened?
He's dead. Can't you see that?
- Who was it?
- Ulaf, the old guy.
New man tomorrow.
What's going on?
Tell them.
Collapsed in the walk way.
- Tell them!
- Tell us what?
What happened?
A doctor came out.
He didn't do much, did he?
Kino?
<i>We will have immediate
facility compliance</i>
<i>or we will begin activating floors
without warning.</i>
Keef! Floor!
What's going on?
The doctor told us
what happened down on Two.
It's true, isn't it?
They fried the whole bridge.
It is worse than that.
- It's why.
- Louder.
He said they made a mistake,
and sent back a man
who'd just been released.
- They fried two shifts to keep it quiet.
- You heard him say this?
How would he know?
I don't believe it.
He's a doctor,
they would never tell...
No one is getting out!
It's true.
The rumors are true.
He said it's true.
They're not letting us go.
Ever.
We're gonna die here,
or in the next place.
So let's get out heads back in our cells,
and start figuring this out.
<i>Kreegyr's men took the bait.</i>
They're asking for a landing bay.
- They found it?
- They're towing it, sir.
"Pilot dead. Ship adrift.
"Port of origin unknown.
"Kafrene Rescue Salvage
reports unresponsive, GPE 7000.
"Operator appears to have frozen following
hydraulic failure on hyperspace re-entry."
It worked.
Now we hang back and wait.
- Suggestion, sir?
- Yes.
I don't think we should step away.
- Go on.
- We should do what we normally do.
Unidentified ship, dead pilot.
We'd want to take a look, wouldn't we?
Let's assume Kreegyr's watching.
The least suspicious thing to do
would be to take an interest.
That is exactly what we will do.
Listen up!
We are done with counting shifts.
There is only then and now.
There is only one way out.
Play it how you want.
But I'm gonna assume I'm already dead,
and take it from there.
There's no sense
in warning the night shift.
They'll hear about it
one way or another soon enough.
Let's make it look good.
<i>New protocol announcement.</i>
<i>All sky bridge transfers will be On-Program
and silent until further notice.</i>
<i>Any shift not in full compliance
will be punished collectively.</i>
<i>On-Program now.</i>
On-Program!
And turn.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Doctor Mullmoy,
we're just not sure what to do.
She needs her meds, she knows it,
but we caught her hiding them now,
and when I asked her
what she thought she was up to
she said your pills put her off of food,
and she'd rather keep eating
than let you keep pretending.
Okay, where is she?
- It's over there.
- Got it. Thanks.
I was here once, 30 years ago.
I'd just left Chandrila,
and my boss at the time
thought I'd enjoy seeing it.
Has it changed much?
I can't tell.
Didn't pay enough attention.
Suppose I thought
I'd be coming back regularly.
It's State property.
The rules are strict on décor.
Our choices for change are limited.
It's a bit old, isn't it?
I like new.
I know it's tasteless and cliché,
but one of the indulgences of great wealth
is freedom from other people's opinions.
You've made your point.
Yes, everyone says you're very direct.
The Senator has many obligations,
she's learned to manage
her time accordingly.
I like when things are clear.
But then I always get to thinking,
what's around the corner?
Mmm, your curiosity
has clearly been profitable.
I've met your husband several times.
I'm sure.
I take it that's not a corner
we're turning in this conversation.
It is not.
Many cultures don't fully appreciate
the clarity of the Chandrilan marriage.
Even our own people are confused at times.
Boundaries can be liberating.
The old ways have value.
Good.
We understand each other.
So, searching for a more
fluid banking situation, are we?
We've discussed all this, Davo.
I'd like to hear her say it.
Yes.
We're exploring alternative
financing arrangements for our foundation.
As Tay has no doubt
already told you,
we've reached a scale in our holdings
that permits
a great variety of transactions
to be bundled in ways
that make outside observation impossible.
Yes, I've been informed.
What's unfortunate
is that people such as yourself,
those with immaculate reputations,
sometimes feel that by taking advantage
of the opportunity
they're somehow tarnished.
The money is yours.
Family wealth is a thing to be proud of
and you ought to be able to move it
as you like with your privacy intact.
The Empire's new regulations, made without
Senate consultation, I might add,
are as cumbersome as they are avoidable.
They've made a game of it and we play.
This is a charitable fund
we're establishing.
So I've been told.
- What will it cost?
- My fee?
We assume it's a percentage
of funds transferred.
I want no fee.
Money means very little to me
at this point.
Charity, isn't it?
- I insist.
- And I refuse.
Please take no offense,
I'd prefer not to owe any favors.
I'd feel far more comfortable
paying you for your trouble.
A drop of discomfort
may be the price of doing business.
Let's have it.
I'd like a return invitation.
I'd like to come back here at least once.
I'm sure that's something
that can be arranged.
I have a 14-year-old son.
I'd like to bring him with me.
You can't be serious.
- I'm not asking for betrothal.
- Then what are we talking about?
An introduction.
Your daughter is 13.
She'll soon come of age.
Two young people.
Attractive and privileged
Chandrilan citizens.
What makes you think
I approve of that tradition?
Our position sometimes makes decisions
for us, don't you find, Senator?
Neither of us have lived a life
that encourages nonconformity.
Is that your only offer?
I'm afraid so.
Tay will see you out.
Of course.
- It's a lot to think about.
- I'm not thinking about it.
That's the first untrue thing you've said.
It's been a pleasure.
There was a mark on the fountain.
Could be anything.
That's what I thought,
so I went to the stairs.
The rail was gone.
A clean break. Fresh.
He wants a meeting, face to face.
There goes the day.
I don't like it.
Not now, I don't like the timing.
You don't like anything.
At the very least
you need to let me go.
Take the Fondor, go to safety
and I'll take care of it.
You know that's not happening.
Stop wasting time.
It's been a year.
I'm surprised he waited this long.
Then if it's a trap?
Oh, if it's a trap, we've already lost.
Hands away.
Are we really doing this?
- You're still on board?
- I want out. Don't care how.
I'm dead. I'm dead.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I'm pretending to be dead.
Don't die until you put up a fight.
One way out.
Come on!
Keep it moving!
Come on!
Pick it up.
Right now, I'm two racks behind!
And we are not
gonna close out the shift like that!
Stop right there.
On-Program. Hands on your head.
Eyes front. Feet down.
Keep it moving!
Come on, come on.
Come on!
Step forward, move, stop there.
Zap-rod.
If I have to use this,
you'll remember it, yes? Yes?
We owe a check on Three.
- Do that now.
- We're already behind.
- Stepping off.
- You're good.
I said eyes front.
Where is he?
- Are they even watching?
- Calm down.
- How?
- I thought you were dead already.
New man ready on 5-2-D,
requesting unit override.
How's it looking out there?
<i>Copy that, coming up.</i>
Looks good.
Okay, go.
Oh, no.
<i>On-Program.</i>
<i>On-Program.</i>
<i>New man on the floor.
Everyone hold positions.</i>
New man on the floor!
Hold your positions!
Lift engaged.
- What'd you say to me?
- I said nothing.
If you wanna say something,
you should say it now.
You start...
Hey! You lot, back on program!
You lot, back on program!
Get back on program!
Whoa, what's going on? What's that?
Now!
What's going on out there?
Go! Go!
- Clear the target.
- What are you doing?
- Come on! Help them!
- Let's go!
Attack!
Spark the floor! Spark the floor!
Get on the tables!
Get on the tables! Get up on the tables!
Spark the floor!
Talk to me!
Right, are you all right?
- You all right? You good?
- I'm okay.
Attack!
We have a situation on 5-2-D.
Repeat, we have a situation...
No! Xaul!
Come on!
Hey!
They're down!
Come on! Climb!
We're in!
Right.
Gimme a hand.
That's it. Go.
Got it.
- Hey, did you see that?
- Yeah, hold up.
What's that?
Where's that coming from?
Hand it off.
Move!
- Kino, come on!
- We need to hold the level!
- Let someone else do that.
- Go! Go!
Blow the consoles!
Keep the doors open!
<i>- What's going on down there?</i>
- I'm not sure, Sir...
<i>I'm looking at a water break.</i>
I've got service warnings on every panel.
<i>Get over there
and check it out. Now.</i>
Check out 5-2-D. Now!
Let's go. Okay.
Go, go.
- Jemboc!
- Taga, come on, let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go. Fall in. Come on.
Go! Go! Go!
One way out!
Come and fight!
What?
Come on.
- Ah!
- We're leaving! Join us!
Climb! Use whatever you can!
Go!
<i>This is a facility-wide
emergency announcement.</i>
<i>Complete program protocol
will commence in 40 seconds.</i>
Any deviation or failure to comply
will result in unit-wide activation.
- Start the count.
- Count engaged.
How much longer
to find the water break?
Techs waiting for a secure floor.
Isolate Five.
Locked in.
5-5, 5-3, 5-6. Burn a firewall around it.
Fry the whole Level.
Make the epicenter 5-2.
Too late.
- There's nobody there.
- You shouldn't be here.
- Turn it off.
- Excuse me?
Turn it off!
That could mean so many things.
I... I'll turn it off.
Step away.
Now!
- Shut down the floors. Everywhere.
- Do it.
No.
Don't just turn it off.
Cut the power.
It's all hydro.
Once we turn it off it takes months
to get it back up and running ag...
I don't have it.
He has the Hydro Gens.
That's the backup power supply.
Get out of there.
There.
With him.
Move!
On-Program! Now!
All yours.
Kino.
Tell them what to do.
It has to be you.
Come on, Kino.
You do this every day.
Tell them what to do.
My name is Kino Loy.
<i>I'm the day shift manager on Level Five.</i>
<i>I'm speaking to you
from the command center on Level Eight.</i>
We are, at this moment,
in control of the facility.
Is that the best you got?
How long we hang on, how far we get,
how many of us make it out,
all of that is now up to us.
We have deactivated
every floor in the facility.
<i>All floors are cold.</i>
<i>Wherever you are right now,
get up, stop the work.</i>
<i>Get out of your cells,
take charge and start climbing.</i>
<i>They don't have enough guards
and they know it.</i>
<i>If we wait until they figure that out,</i>
it'll be too late.
We will never have
a better chance than this
and "I would rather die
trying to take them down
"than giving them what they want."
We know they fried
a hundred men on Level Two.
We know that they are making up
our sentences as we go along.
<i>We know that no one outside here
knows what's happening.</i>
<i>And now we know,
that when they say we are being released,</i>
we are being transferred
to some other prison
to go and die and that ends today!
There is one way out.
Right now, the building is ours.
You need to run, climb, kill!
<i>You need to help each other.</i>
<i>You see someone who's confused,
someone who is lost,</i>
you get them moving
and you keep them moving
until we put this place behind us.
<i>There are 5,000 of us.</i>
<i>If we can fight half as hard
as we've been working,</i>
<i>we will be home in no time.</i>
<i>One way out!</i>
<i>One way out!</i>
One way out!
- One way out!
- One way out! One way out!
One way out!
One way out! One way out...
Come on!
Let's get out of here!
Quiet.
One way out!
Whatever happens now, we made it!
What's wrong?
Can't swim.
- What?
- What did he say?
I can't swim!
<i>If this is a trap,
press the buttons for 215.</i>
<i>We'll have privacy.</i>
<i>We're running express.</i>
<i>First of all, congratulations.</i>
- On what?
<i>- Your daughter.</i>
<i>Healthy. Beautiful. You must be pleased.</i>
Is that meant to scare me?
<i>Well, it's been a year
since we've had a chance to catch up.</i>
<i>You've become a father.</i>
<i>- It's not worth mentioning?</i>
- It's not fair.
You knowing.
Watching me.
Do you ever think
how it might feel from my side?
<i>I think about you constantly.</i>
<i>Why are we here tonight, Lonni?</i>
There's a new supervisor rising.
Dedra Meero.
She's focused
on a suspect she's calling Axis.
She thinks he's building a rebel network.
She started looking
into stolen Imperial Naval equipment
and now she's looking
for a link to Aldhani.
<i>Dedra Meero.</i>
There was an incident on Ferrix
a few months ago.
She thinks there's a link.
She's been tearing the place apart.
They're searching
for a thief and the middleman.
<i>Huh. "Axis."</i>
She's gathering interest.
Partagaz likes her.
<i>Well, this is good.</i>
<i>Encourage this.</i>
Why is this good?
<i>Because she's wasting time.</i>
You had nothing to do with Aldhani?
<i>Well, almost nothing.
We were invited, but declined.</i>
<i>They got lucky. We don't build on luck.</i>
<i>But this can't be why you're here.</i>
She just captured a Rebel pilot
running supplies for Anto Kreegyr.
They turned him immediately
and staged an accident.
We know that there's a raid planned
on the power station at Spellhaus.
If Kreegyr attacks, they'll be waiting.
<i>And if he doesn't,
they'll know something's amiss.</i>
They'll be slaughtered.
<i>It's 50 men.</i>
<i>- You're worth more than that.</i>
- You have to warn them.
<i>To what end?</i>
<i>Ruin everything?</i>
<i>What better way to reassure the ISB</i>
<i>there's no leak in security
than sacrificing Kreegyr.</i>
<i>I'm doing this for you
as much as anything.</i>
Tell me
why we're really here today, Lonni?
I can't do this anymore.
I'm a father now.
I had no idea how it would feel.
We took a vow.
I'm giving you Dedra Meero.
I'm giving you Spellhaus.
I'm warning you about Ferrix.
I'm honoring my vow.
I've been working my way
through there for six years.
Working my way up.
Alone.
So, what was your plan?
Gather a big basket of goodies for me
as a farewell gift?
What were you planning to tell the ISB?
My health.
My wife's family has an import business.
Even as you say the words,
you know it's impossible.
We can't let you go, Lonni.
We can't spare you.
We've been grooming you for too long.
And yes, you've been alone,
but your career has profited greatly
from information that we've provided.
Information that cost me dearly.
You love your daughter.
Kreegyr's men will be dying
to make sure she has a father.
You're trapped, Lonni.
There's no pleasure in saying it
but you're going nowhere.
My sacrifice?
It means nothing to you, does it?
I said I think of you constantly and I do.
Your investment in the Rebellion is epic.
A double life? Every day a performance?
The stress of that?
We need heroes, Lonni, and here you are.
And what do you sacrifice?
Calm.
Kindness. Kinship.
Love.
I've given up all chance at inner peace.
I've made my mind a sunless space.
I share my dreams with ghosts.
I wake up every day
to an equation I wrote 15 years ago
from which there's only one conclusion,
I'm damned for what I do.
My anger, my ego,
my unwillingness to yield,
my eagerness to fight,
they've set me on a path
from which there is no escape.
I yearned to be a savior against injustice
without contemplating the cost
and by the time I looked down
there was no longer
any ground beneath my feet.
What is my sacrifice?
I'm condemned to use
the tools of my enemy to defeat them.
I burn my decency
for someone else's future.
I burn my life to make a sunrise
that I know I'll never see.
And the ego that started this fight
will never have a mirror
or an audience or the light of gratitude.
So what do I sacrifice?
Everything!
You'll stay with me, Lonni.
I need all the heroes I can get.

﻿1
So, searching for a more fluid
banking situation, are we?
What will it cost?
I have a 14-year-old son.
I'd like to bring him with me.
- I'm not asking for betrothal.
- Then what are we talking about?
[Davo] <i>An introduction.</i>
<i>Your daughter is 13.
She'll soon come of age.</i>
<i>Two young people.</i>
<i>Attractive and privileged
Chandrilan citizens.</i>
What makes you think I
approve of that tradition?
<i>Our position sometimes makes
decisions for us, don't you find?</i>
[Krole] <i>I'm only here for
another couple of days.</i>
<i>Maybe you'd like to join me.</i>
I'm not sure my
husband would approve.
Is he here?
[Gerdis] You can
stop right there!
You got 15 blasters
pointed at you right now!
[grunting]
[Krole] <i>Does he worry about you?</i>
In what way?
[Krole] We've just shut
down all the comms.
We freeze the zone
during an audit.
It's supposed to stop things sneaking
away while we're doing all our counting.
[Kleya] <i>Nothing.</i>
Radio silence.
Nobody's checked in.
I need to be at the gallery.
I can't help anyone from
here. I need serious comms.
[Dedra] Is that everything?
I was sure if I went
shopping, you'd be delayed,
and we wouldn't have to do this.
No such luck.
We could... pretend
that you're not back.
I have concerns. The
Foundation is up and running.
Your financial blemishes
have been smoothed over
without anyone being the wiser.
Davo Sculdun obviously
has what he came for.
Everyone seems quite pleased
with how they've landed,
<i>and I'm left wondering about
the risk I've taken on.</i>
[Luthen] <i>It's very troubling.</i>
We'll find a number.
Is there any chance
he'd go to Sculdun?
No, he wouldn't dare.
He can't.
[indistinct shouting]
Let your weapon fall.
[grunts]
[indistinct shouting]
He's out! He's getting away!
Come on!
Bring it down!

[farmer 1] Mmm. There's

[Brasso] Yeah. Pay

[Brasso] Some of us
need more than others.
[all laughing]
[Talia] All your whinin'.

And, uh, who's helping me bring all
that's left back up the mound tonight?
Oh, I think we have a volunteer.
[all laughing]

Be back in a minute. Keep an
eye on my bowl, would you?
[farmer 3] No guarantee.
Sorry, I tried to get
here earlier, but...
[sighs] You've got
a lot going on.
Still no Cassian?
I got the call from Six
Hundred this morning.
I wish I had better news.
We're next on the
inspection schedule.
How soon?
They finished there today, so...
tomorrow?
- Are they checking visas?
- It's random.
They found a group hiding
last night in Six Hundred.
Sometimes, they walk right by.
It's a big risk.
Where can we go?
This is the best I could do.
It's an Emergency Work Order
for the Eight Hundred Block.
Three sweepers that need fixing.
You head out tonight, wait till
they finish poking around here,
then circle back
'round in a few days.
Is it legit?
I had to change the date.
You only use it tonight
if you got stopped.
Sorry about this, Kellen.
- You've been a savior.
- Please.
You know Cassian's friend?
The big boss?
If you do and don't want
to say so, that's fine.
But someone needs to tell
him what's going on here.
It's going on everywhere.
[sighs]
Why can't they just
leave us in peace?
Keep your head down.
- [indistinct chatter]
- [woman laughing]
[indistinct chatter]
Ah. [chuckles softly]
I was getting worried.
My gown got snagged.
Oh, no. Is it all right?
I think I stopped in time.
It's fine.
Really is.
Are you nervous?
Of course I'm nervous.
I was awake all night
worrying about you.
Are they all out there?
They can wait.
My mother was drunk when
I got married. [chuckles]
This room.
Right here. [chuckles]
Just like this.
I was so angry, I don't
think I ever forgave her.
But I could never understand why
she'd done it until just now.
What are you doing?
I need to tell you
- what my mother never told me.
- [woman laughs]
Look at me.
Nothing on the other side
of that door matters.
Not the guests, not the gifts, not
the... trouble that's gone into it,
none of it matters.
Money, embarrassment,
pressure...
Wha... What are you saying?
We can walk out there right now,
tell them all to have
a lovely afternoon,
but that it's not yet
time for a marriage.
We can put it off.
[breath trembling]
And it will be remembered
as an act of great bravery,
I promise you.
You do not have to
go through with this.
I wish you were drunk.

You look nothing

[Syril chuckles softly]
Here, let me... get your coat.
- Ah!
- [Syril clears throat]
How refreshing.
One longs for courtesy,
don't you think?
Yes, absolutely.
And there is so little of it.
What can I get you to drink?
Don't you wonder what I
thought you'd look like?
I'm afraid to ask.
Do you have spiced tea?
- Since when are you drinking spiced tea?
- "When?"
I see you so rarely.
Are we not allowed
to change? [chuckles]
Well, we don't have spiced tea.
Uh...
They're still open downstairs.
Syril, please, no.
No. I'll have what
you're having.
There's a shop in the arcade.
No, please.
I did not come all this way
to see Syril disappear again.
Show me your wonderful home.

You won't be hearing from him.

[Kleya] <i>Let's start over.

Did anyone know that?
I can't fly the ship.

[Eedy] Children have
so much to teach us.
It's a lesson that never ends.
Syril's imagination had
always fascinated me.
- Mother, you're dripping.
- It's fine.
I suppose we're fascinated by the
things we don't understand. [chuckling]
Now, Syril's father fancied
himself an adventurer.
It was an expensive delusion.
One day, suddenly, he was gone.
And all we had was each other.
A young, delicate boy with only a
mother's love and determination.
If not for the charity
of his Uncle Harlo,
I can't imagine where we'd be.
What a difficult time
that must have been.
Syril's shared
the story with me.
Really?
Oh! [chuckles]
Well, isn't this
a day to remember?
Can I say how
pleasing it is to hear
he's found someone with whom
he can actually communicate?
- Mother, would you like some...
- I'll get there.
Yeah. Yup. Okay.
- [sighs]
- [Eedy chuckles]
- [Syril clears throat]
- He's embarrassed.
About what?
Doesn't like being
called delicate.
I was just asking if you
wanted some more sauce.
Hmm. Oh!
Tell me about your family.
I don't have one.
My parents were criminals.
They were arrested
when I was three.
I was raised in an
Imperial Kinder-block.
Well... [smacks lips]
Nothing delicate
about that, is there?
We had everything we needed.
[smacks lips] Except
a mother's love.
We didn't know what
we were missing.

I'll do it.
We'll wait to break down a cab.

- Sundown.
You never cleaned these tools?
We'll do it when we get there.
[♪ music fades]
[spoon banging on plate]
These are lovely.
Not too sweet.
I was told you like them.
Pleasures of Coruscant.
[sniffles] I told Syril,
when he insisted on playing
at police work on Morlana,
that the benefits of life here
would become clear by contrast.
What are you saying? That
I came home for the cakes?
[chuckling] Well, less said
about that, the better.
And I wasn't
playing at anything.
[Eedy] Of course not.
Main thing is, we're
all here together now.
[scoffs]
Yeah.
Be right back. [coughs]
You'll toughen him up.
I have a different plan in mind.
Mmm, but when I say the word "plan,"
that makes it sound optional,
which is not the impression
you should be taking away.
This game ends now.
You want Syril in your life?
You will think before you speak.
I'll make sure he
visits twice a month.
I'll make sure
that he calls you.
I will guarantee a level of engagement,
but it will be inversely proportional
to the volume of anxiety
you generate in our lives.
- Quite a mouthful.
- I'm not done.
You can spare me the
Uncle Harlo testimonials.
I've had a look at his
ISB criminal files,
and that is not a story
you want to be advertising.
[♪ tense music playing]
[Eedy chuckles]
[Dedra] Apparently I've lost
count. He's been promoted twice.
[Eedy] Wonderful.
[Dedra] More caf?
[Eedy] Please.

- [breathes deeply]

Oh, Syril.
Dedra was just telling me
how well you're doing here.
Was she?
And I told her that came
as no surprise to me.
[Syril] That's interesting.
Perhaps some more cakes?
[Syril clears throat]
[all gasping]
[Davo] Yes, it is real.
[all laughing]
For those of you who are visiting
today, this is a Chandi Merle.
It's a temple figure, one of 12
that was stolen 25,000 years ago
when Chandrila was sacked
by Rakatan invaders.
Until today, there were only
eight of these accounted for.
And only five that had
made their way back home.
This is Luthen Rael, everybody,
- for those of you who've not met.
- [indistinct chatter]
Luthen came to me
last year with a rumor
that became a possibility,
that became an adventure.

So in the pantheon of Chandrilan

I'm afraid it's my first.
Oh, I thought you
were a local boy.
Ah, not really.
Well, my father's Chandrilan.
I was born in Naboo.
- My mother's Ghorman.
- Oh.
He was married.
It was a scandal.
Where were you raised?
Well, we weren't really
welcome anywhere for a while.
We bounced around until she passed
away, and then Mon stepped in.
Oh! Sorry. Erskin, excuse me.
[chuckles]
[indistinct chatter]
<i>- Sagrona.</i>
- [Mon] Mmm. <i>Sagrona Teema.</i>
Ever thought you'd have a
Chandi Merle in your ballroom?
- [Mon chuckles]
- [Squidna] Mon, we'll see you there.
- Come on, Sordo.
- [Sordo] Yes, I'm coming.
He puts on quite a
show, doesn't he?
- [Tay] Yeah.
- [indistinct conversation]
[Tay] He's a lesson for us all.
- What would that be?
- Well...
Speak up, stand up,
make your point.
Every time I'm with him, I'm
reminded how timid I've become.
Every time you're with him?
- Is that a regular occurrence?
- I hope so.
He could be very
helpful to me right now.
But we'll, we'll discuss all
this on Coruscant next week.
[♪ uneasy music playing]
Of course.
It's good timing.
Listen, I came by now,
I have to leave a little early.
And I don't want to keep
abusing your good spirits.

it. I've known him my whole life.
People fail. That's our curse.
What would've happened if I wasn't
here? Would you have told me?
I'm meeting him next week.
Yes, yes, I would have told you.
I'll warn him off. I'll

Get the speeder.

Brasso!
Brasso!
Come on. Hey.
Hey, Brasso...
[breathing heavily]
Come on.

Cassian!
[Wilmon] Cass!
[Bix] Cassian!
[Cassian] Hey!
What happened?
We need to go.
We need Brasso.
Get in. Get in!
Come on. Come on!

The restraints are nothing to be feared.
It's much safer for you to
be tethered as we engage.
<i>It doesn't take long.</i>
It won't feel that way to you.
No!
- No! No!
- Bix. Wake up.
You're okay. You're okay...
<i>You're fine. You're safe.</i>
Spiders are not the most
unique thing in ghorman.
There's a mineral underground. Doctor!
Deep substrate foliated kalkite.
The kalkite extraction, I'm
assuming it's an invasive process.
The extent of our withdrawal
may render the planet unstable.
There is a risk of... total collapse.
We don't have a large presence
on ghorman at the moment.
He's planned for that.
We're building a new armory in palmo.
Excuse me?
We're starting tomorrow.
Propaganda will only get you so far.
You need a radical
insurgency you can count on.
You need ghorman rebels you
can depend on to do the wrong thing.
- Did krennic offer you the job?
- You know that he did.
Then it's done. We're in it.
Ghorman will be yours
to run as you wish.
You'll only answer to krennic and
he's got no time for anything but results.
There are no small jobs here
at the bureau of standards.
You may hear that and
wonder how it can be true.
But... not that long ago, I was
standing right where you are now.
Syril, dedra was just telling
me how well you're doing here.
Was she?
And I told her that came
as no surprise to me.
No sign of your husband?
He'll be back.
There you are.
He told me everything.
I know you wanted him to live, but
cassian said he'd seen your faces, so...
You tried.
He knows that.
Wherever he is.
Wasn't much of a soldier, was he?
They'll never find his body.
His family will never
know what happened.
I
I forgot to ask his name.
Might be a bit late now.
Everyone has their own rebellion.
Right?
Breathe. Breathe.
Same thing again? Dr. Gorst?
- You wanna talk about it?
- Just go back to bed.
It's been a while now.
It's being home. Here.
Whatever this place is.
It's when I relax.
We still need to do something
about these windows.
Yeah. We can do that tomorrow.
Get some decent plates.
And towels.
If we're gonna keep coming back,
- we might as well settle in.
- Hey. Hey.
You sure you don't wanna talk about it?
Bix.
I can barely see you.
Turn it.
<i>Mother?</i>
<i>- The other way?
- It's the connection.</i>
The other way.
You might as well be in the outer rim.
- I'm seeing you clearly.
- How nice for you.
There. There, you had it.
- Don't worry about me.
- I'll try to remember what you look like.
- It's an imperial signal.
- It should be fine.
Where are you?
I am in my office.
Requesting a transfer, I hope.
I like it here.
I think you've got spiders in your brain.
<i>Or whatever those things
are called. The web weavers?</i>
Ghorlectipods.
- Good morning, sir.
- The thought of it.
<i>No one understands
what you're doing out there.</i>
And when you say "no one," I'm
assuming you mean uncle harlo?
He says you're deluded if you
think ghorman was a promotion.
His advice is always uplifting.
You're being cast aside.
<i>You're being discarded
and too naive to see it.</i>
- Morning.
- I'm in charge here, mother.
They've put you on the shelf,
syril. You've been played.
You, of all people, should understand
<i>the attraction of being in charge.</i>
- In charge? Of what?
- Counting spiders?
<i>Let's not forget your last
foray into the provinces.</i>
This is the bureau of
standards field office in ghorman.
It's hardly the provinces.
What it is, hardly, is Coruscant.
You were here.
I'd fixed it. You'd made it back.
People die trying for a
desk at headquarters.
<i>And then they die at those desks.</i>
You were here, syril.
You'd found a woman actually
willing to make a life with you,
<i>and you just walk away?</i>
<i>A respectable career,
a relationship, finally?</i>
<i>All of it cast aside,
thrown away, and for what?</i>
A field office on ghorman?
- I'm assuming you won't be visiting.
- They won't get another credit of mine.
<i>I'm not buying ghorman again.</i>
<i>I'm sick of it.</i>
<i>They were always too
good for the rest of us.</i>
You are watching too
much imperial news.
<i>My opinions were well-established
before you relocated.</i>
These are decent people.
Syril, I have met some
ghormans in my time.
<i>Uncle harlo used to wear
nothing but ghorman twill.</i>
<i>Who wouldn't, if you could afford it?</i>
<i>But the attitude. The arrogance.</i>
<i>- Those holo-drops?
- This mockery of emperor palpatine?</i>
<i>You must have seen them. How
could you not? It's scandalous.</i>
- It's propaganda.
- Mother, you're being sold these ideas.
My poor boy.
<i>Your gullibility is breathtaking.</i>
All this anti-ghormanism,
it's not just talk anymore.
<i>We're getting new directives every
month and people are getting hurt.</i>
You're too close to know
what's really going on.
I'll tell you how close I am.
There are people in my office.
I'm looking at two of them right now.
They'll be choking down loyalty
oaths next week just to keep their jobs.
<i>I feel safer already.</i>
I'm here. I see what I see.
<i>This place is hardly
a threat to the empire.</i>
Don't become too much
of an individual, syril.
I have spiders to count.
<i>Same time next wee...</i>
This place is hardly
a threat to the empire.
Don't become too much
of an individual, syril.
- I have spiders to count.
- Same time next wee...
Hey.
- What?
- Let me see the bag.
- What for?
- Let me see the bag.
- Seriously?
- I don't like this place.
I thought you meant the other one.
I meant the good one.
This is the good one.
- We need to mix it up.
- We haven't been here for a month.
Look at us.
I can't sleep. You can't shop.
The mission is dinner.
I think we can handle it.
Okay. Come.
Hello there. What can I do for you two?
We got some lovely new fruits in.
- What about the melons?
- Excellent choice. They're in season.
Fresh from ukio. I'll find a good one.
I need three.
Ripe tonight or tomorrow?
Tonight.
I haven't seen you for a
while. Thought I'd lost you.
I've been around.
These are lovely. For a lovely lady.
- Anything else today?
- No. No, no. We're good.
Are those moski peppers?
Extra hot.
My husband wants a taste.
Is he strong enough?
He's tougher than he looks.
Okay.
One? Got two.
This is a lovely one.
- You, sir?
- Seriously?
Perhaps you've changed your mind.
- Really? Tonight's the night?
- Well, these are special.
I'm not a tourist. You know it.
- This one's different.
- I'm not buying another spider.
This one's free.
What do you want?
You're right. You're not a tourist.
Perhaps you wish to know
more about where you live.
There's a candy inside with
information on the wrapper.
- About what?
- There's a meeting.
You should come. You have the address.
We should've done this before.
There's already tarnish.
We were tired. We needed the rest.
Clean it with dirjo.
There's not much left.
Put it on the list.
Who else stays here?
You ever think about that?
No one's been here while we were gone.
You should see if we can leave stuff.
If we're gonna keep coming back.
I'll ask him.
What are you gonna tell him?
About what?
About what happened on
the mission. The soldier.
Luthen cares about results.
The deal went through. We won.
It had to be done.
There's nothing else to say.
What?
Hey, he was a threat.
He was a soldier.
Bix, you put on the uniform,
you take your chances.
I should stop thinking about him.
It's tough like this.
Boxed in.
It's like you said. It's when we relax.
I can't stop seeing his face.
It fades.
I wanna tell you it goes
away forever, but... I'd be lying.
Look at us.
Look at this place.
We're in a war.
Not everybody knows
it yet, but it's happening.
- People die.
- I wonder if he knew.
Well, he does now.
He was a soldier. He was a threat.
He was an imperial threat.
You and I are here
now because he's dead.
It had to be done.
It's good.
You sound surprised.
You're better than I am.
No, no. No, no, no. I'm
not gonna fall for that one.
Can we walk tomorrow?
That sounds nice.
The park. The big one.
I told you, they... They put cameras in.
We can cover up.
There's other places.
We're safe here.
I know it's not what we want, but...
The insanity of the city keeps us safe.
Then why are we being so paranoid?
- Just trying to protect us.
- You mean me.
- What's so wrong about that?
- It's warping things.
I don't wanna lose you again.
That's not up to us anymore.
You can't protect me.
Doing this... living like this...
Mission after mission.
If it's a war,
and you keep saying it is,
and I know that you're right,
but if it's a war, it's not
up to us what we save,
what we lose.
I love you.
And I regret every second
that we didn't spend together.
But I'm trying not to
count on anything anymore.
What am I messing up?
I can handle more than you think.
Which is why you are
awake every other night.
I'm not maarva. I'm not your sister.
- I can...
- seriously.
- I can handle it.
- What am I messing up?
You didn't kill that boy
because we're at war.
You killed him because he saw my face.
What's the difference?
I don't know.
But if I'm giving up everything.
I want to win. We have to.
I, left some files in the office.
Syril karn, division chief,
bureau of standards.
I know you.
It's gonna want after-hours clearance.
It'll take five minutes.
Sorry. We're not authorized.
I have a presentation with the
sector committee tomorrow morning.
I left my notes on my desk
like an idiot. I have to have them.
Take me five minutes.
Or I could tell you where they are.
- Where are you?
- The safe room.
- You were careful?
- Yes, of course, always.
- Look, I don't have much time.
- Sorry. Tell me.
They made contact.
<i>I've been invited to a meeting.</i>
- A meeting with who?
- I don't know. It's public.
It's a town hall. But this is them.
It's ghorman front. I know it.
<i>- How? How do you know?
- I told you I was being watched.</i>
They started breaking into the apartment.
I know they're tapping the office comms.
I assume I'm being followed all the time.
It has to be them. Who else could it be?
<i>- The meeting's tomorrow.
- Good.</i>
Very good.
Well, let's wait and see what happens.
<i>Well, I thought you'd
wanna brief partagaz.</i>
No.
<i>He'll want more than that.</i>
The 12 raids, conducted over all
three planets were highly successful.
Giving us a total of eight
seizures, yielding 200,000 credits,
75 restricted imperial
weapons and 34 arrests.
All of which leads us where?
We're ingesting the data.
- This was ten days ago?
- Yes, sir.
We? Who's the "we" at
this buffet of rebel plunder?
It's my sector, sir.
Supervisor heert.
- Yes, sir.
- The axis desk,
I notice you've taken
an interest in this seizure.
The weapons, sir. There are some pieces
that have come from
the axis supply chain.
Have we nothing more definitive?
- No, sir. Not yet.
- Not yet?
Ten days, two supervisors,
30 suspects in custody,
and we are still
ingesting and speculating.
Where's the intel?
So what do we squeeze
from these arrests that matter?
- No argument there, sir.
- Hardly the tempo required
for effective counterinsurgency.
It's disappointing on many levels.
I see a variety of causes.
Pick one!
We're arresting too many people.
We can't take it all in.
Go on.
Many of us...
Some of us...
Some of us have more people
in custody than we can process.
Supervisor jung raises a serious issue.
The problem is not unknown to me.
Colonel yularen and myself have a
meeting scheduled with the emperor
to discuss amplifying our intake process.
Well played, lonni.
Thank you for reminding us all
how this room is meant to function.
Let's get to work.
Thank you. I mean it.
- I'm having the same problems.
- I can't keep up.
We should talk it over. Not here, but.
I'm in all day.
You're onto something.
That's the job, isn't it?
Seventy-five restricted
imperial weapons?
You've had that ten days?
It's my desk now, dedra.
You don't call me in?
You don't think I could be helpful?
I won't hesitate if I need it.
Do you really think I care
about how it happens?
Andor must be found.
You can have all the glory.
Has it ever crossed your mind
that partagaz put me on axis
because I don't seek glory?
Well...
You've given me a lot to think about.
My door is open.
That doesn't look happy.
Yeah. She's been transferred.
Everything's pissing her off.
- I won't ask.
- But you, thank you.
He was gonna chew his way
through lagret and eat me for fun.
I don't know what I was thinking.
How do I repay you?
You can buy me lunch.
Done.
The p.O.R.D. Was presented as an
emergency measure, an overreaction.
<i>It was never meant to be permanent.</i>
The emperor might disagree.
Well, then, why ask for an extension?
Why?
Perhaps he just likes to see us dance.
Ghorman needs this
legislation more than anyone.
If I can't count on your
support, what's the point?
I need votes.
And you've been hiding from me. Why?
Sector boundaries, civil liberties,
personal freedom,
respect for local traditions.
You've been voting with
me on these issues for years.
This is security, mon.
You're confusing
criminality and politics here.
Really?
Are we finding criminals
or making them?
Why?
Why this? Why that?
I can't support the bill because
I can't risk chafing the emperor.
But why I'm in this position and
why it seems to be intensifying,
and why ghorman is
being persecuted so intently,
are questions no one
seems prepared to answer.
Go back two years.
Take the 75 planets with
the lowest crime rates.
Look at them now.
They're up 19%.
We can all game the numbers, mon.
And whose numbers are they?
I believe what I feel.
All doubts aside, there
is one glaring certainty.
If we do not stand
together, we will be crushed.
I know how hard
you're working this, mon.
I am close on the votes.
That's not what I hear.
Look at just the conviction
numbers we're allowed to see
in the places we know are peaceful.
An 18% rise in kaifo. Tepasi, 21.
A 38% increase in ghorman.
Ghorman, of all places.
I'm not sure linking anything to
ghorman right now is a good idea.
- The blockade.
- Who was there for you?
Who rallied the votes to lift the embargo?
I have never stopped thanking you.
Then help me kill the p.O.R.D.
Ghorman is a single-product economy.
We import almost
everything we need to survive.
The blockade didn't have to go very
long to remind us how vulnerable we are.
Dasi...
No.
I am constantly begging
my people to stay calm
and do nothing that
might make things worse.
Voting against the emperor right now
would be a total violation of that request.
Ghorman cannot take the risk.
I'm sorry, mon.
Hello, lonni.
- You've kept me waiting.
- I've been careful.
- Three months.
- I didn't have anything solid until today.
Well, let's have it.
You ask two questions.
One answers the other.
Spit it out!
Dedra meero is running ghorman.
She's been on it all year.
All this time. Hiding it.
I doubt there's three
people in the building
that know what I've just told you.
Why? Why ghorman?
I don't know. I can't believe
they've kept it so quiet.
Everybody thinks that she's
been put out to pasture since ferrix.
What's the obsession with
ghorman? What are they after?
I don't know. I'm trying to rethink
this all with her in the picture.
It doesn't make sense.
All the propaganda.
That can't be isb. It's too
slick. That's outside help.
And meero. Why? She's
a hunter, not a spin doctor.
- Maybe she's oversight.
- Of what?
A smear campaign is an
opening move, not an endgame.
I need the endgame!
I don't have it.
I'm trying.
Are you sure of this?
As of today.
And meero's off axis for good?
Not by choice, but yes.
I can't wait another three months,
lonni. There's too much going on.
You used to tell me to wait.
Those days are gone.
You're up-to-date on
the signal sequence?
Yes.
We'll be standing by.
{\an8}Le... lezine!
What do you think?
It's very passionate.
How much do you understand?
Not enough.
{\an8}She lost her family
in the tarkin massacre.
There was a promise that
the new imperial building
would never cast a
shadow across the memorial.
{\an8}Now they know the truth.
{\an8}Lezine!
{\an8}People think the new building
is meant to be a fortress.
He's telling them he doesn't know.
What do you think?
{\an8}Hello.
{\an8}- How are you?
- Her name is enza.
{\an8}Syril.
He's an imperial spy. Be careful.
It's not funny.
- It's not true, is it?
- No. I...
He invited me.
I'm at the bureau of standards.
Yeah. That's a relief.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I was thinking of
introducing you to my father.
Elector rylanz.
Syril karn.
I saw you from the stage.
I stand out that much?
No, that's what's interesting.
You're very brave to be here.
Am I in danger?
Certainly not from us.
This is ghorman.
I was wondering about your people.
There are no restrictions
on my movements in palmo.
And what will you take
away from this evening?
The strength of feeling.
Will you be writing a report?
No, I... to who?
I'm here as myself.
What a refreshing position.
It might be helpful to have your advice.
There must be some way to
make our appeals more effective.
I'm not sure that's allowed.
Is there a law against
seeking imperial counsel?
I suppose not.
We're drowning in rumors, syril.
Many people are starting to think this
new building is more than just an annex.
I'm not sure why the empire would
build an armory in the middle of palmo,
but I'm running out of answers.
Well, I have nothing
to do with the annex.
You must've seen the floor plans.
Those are classified.
Certainly lends weight to the rumors.
I wouldn't know.
Sixteen years ago, grand moff tarkin
killed 500 peaceful, unarmed
ghormans in the middle of that Plaza.
You can imagine how
upset we would be to find out
there's an imperial military facility
rising over the monument to the fallen.
Yes.
Ghormans yearn for
peace and prosperity.
If you are writing a report...
Make that your headline.
Maybe we can do some good together.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah.
Couldn't sleep.
Dr. Gorst?
Not tonight.
Have a look.
It's flashing.
{\an8}We just got back.
Ever been to ghorman?
Where they make the fabric? No.
I want you to try something different.
This will be clean work. You
bring nothing but your wits.
I need an assessment.
Of what?
Of who. Carro rylanz.
Businessman, city official.
- He's running the ghorman front.
- You know him?
In my way.
We never met.
Kleya put a radio in,
there was a rebel pilot that went
down and we tried to help, but.
I can't go. He's too visible.
I'm not sure about the group.
It's a different kind of mission,
but it's not without danger.
And bix?
No, not this time.
No.
You have to go alone.
I have to think about that.
Think about this.
Think about the empire
choking ghorman so hard
that even carro rylanz
gets off his comfortable ass
to do something about it.
Ghorman would be a
remarkable place to turn our way.
I need to know more
before we get involved.
Bix will be fine.
You don't know that.
And I haven't said yes.
Reach out to kleya.
I want this done quickly.
Look at you.
Look at all your loveliness.
How I have dreamt of this.
Is she healthy?
Yes.
Everything's here?
All the tools? Full kit?
Eight variations. Six gauges.
Think of it, comrades. Fuel on demand.
All the rhydo that you can steal.
A galaxy of opportunities!
Work up a thirst. Find a vein.
Take what you want, when you want it.
Yes.
Has it been tested?
It works.
Who taught you this?
Why is that important?
Why?
What's more dangerous
than rhydonium?
Not many old pipe-poachers out there.
Not many who've lived to tell the tale.
Who taught you this?
I'm here to teach the variations.
More than that, I'm not allowed to say.
Look at this.
A brave one!
But how brave?
Have you ever seen a
man die from rhydonium?
Maybe you're like me,
maybe you, you love...
The smell of it.
And maybe you breathe
just a little too deeply.
Burned from the inside.
You watch your skin
blister as it melts away.
Or, you die loud.
Cut a line? Drop a wrench? Let it spill?
Don't even need a spark, do you, boy?
Do you?
Boom!
Burn from the outside.
What do they call you?
- Wilmon.
- Wil. Mon.
Wilmon the boy.
Have you ever done this for
real? Or just in a classroom?
I've done it.
Never alone, but I've done it.
- Twice.
- And you're still alive.
Pluti.
Pluti.
This is pluti.
He's smarter than he
looks. He'll be your student.
- Which variation?
- Pick one.
Start with your favorite.
Well, we should concentrate on
the station you're planning to hit.
You'll teach them all.
You'll know where we're
going when I tell you.
- But I need to leave tomorrow.
- Really?
- Is that what you need?
- It was an agreement.
This was negotiated.
I'll let our friend know that
you're being taken care of.
Find him a place to sleep.
You're here till I get what I need.

﻿1
You need a radical
insurgency you can count on.
You need ghorman rebels you
can depend on to do the wrong thing.
<i>We're safe here.</i>
<i>Then why are we being so paranoid?</i>
- Just trying to protect us.

it. You'd made it back.

willing to make a life with you,</i>

Such a pleasure to finally meet you.
Finally indeed.
- I'm not buying another spider.
- This one's free.
You're right. You're not a tourist.

more about where you live.</i>
<i>They made contact. I've

{\an8}Corell <i>ia 2-2-2.</i>
<i>Ryloth 7-4-8.</i>
<i>I feel like ever since we moved in here...</i>
<i>Really uncomfortable, if I grabbed...</i>
<i>Sculdun 3-4-3.</i>
- <i>We're not to be interrupted.
- Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Well?</i>
<i>It's a forgery.</i>
<i>- It's a good one, but...
- It should be.</i>
<i>It certainly cost enough.</i>
<i>I won't tell you what I paid for it.</i>
<i>Unfortunately, the
dealer... you're up early.</i>
Anything urgent?
Not yet.
And our friend's on his way?
Stop.
Someone here!
Can I help you?
Ghorman?
Visiting friends?
Why do you ask?
I'm curious by nature.
I have friends everywhere.
Bon!
What do we have for ghorman?
<i>Your name is varian Skye.</i>
<i>You were born in tahini</i>
<i>and moved to Coruscant with
your brother when you were 12.</i>
<i>Your brother, patrio,
soon returned home,</i>
<i>but you'd found an apprenticeship
in a dressmaking studio</i>
<i>and decided to stay.</i>
<i>After your apprenticeship,
you moved to the fashion district</i>
<i>where you found work as
an assistant to a designer.</i>
<i>Just wanted to let you know
I'm coming home this weekend.</i>
<i>What a pleasant surprise!</i>
I'm just worried if I don't
come now, it might be a while.
There's a rumor they might be
tightening up the travel restrictions here.
<i>I thought you were in charge.</i>
<i>This is hardly a bureau
of standards issue.</i>
<i>I hope someone who knows
what they're doing is watching out.</i>
<i>For what?</i>
<i>Your safety.</i>
<i>Well, they're definitely watching out.</i>
What they're looking for is a mystery.
There's not much in
the way of danger here.
- <i>When would you arrive?
- Hang on.</i>
- I gotta go, mother, I'll let you know.
- Wait
listen up!
I need everybody to step
away from their workstations
<i>and leave the room immediately.</i>
What's going on here?
They're telling us all to leave.
No, stay where you are.
Syril karn?
Yes?
I'm attendant grymish from isb tech.
We have reason to believe there
are listening devices in this office.
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.
We need everyone out immediately.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait.
We're in the middle of an audit.
What you're in the middle
of, sir, is an isb tech sweep.
Everyone in here will be in
custody until we finish our evaluation.
What do you mean "custody?"
On whose authority? This is my office.
Are you refusing a direct imperial order?
This is insane.
Take him.
Are you... come...
everybody... everybody out!
- Calling headquarters!
- Yeah, good luck with that.
Anyone else wanna argue?
<i>Sculdun 3-4-3.</i>
- <i>We're not to be interrupted.
- Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Well?</i>
<i>It's a forgery.</i>
<i>It's a good one, but</i>
<i>it should be. It certainly cost enough.</i>
I won't tell you what I paid for it.
Unfortunately, the dealer
I bought it from is dead.
He's lucky he's dead.
Well, he may have been
fooled as much as we were.
<i>As of this moment, everything
in the room is under suspicion.</i>
What else have we missed?
Even the finest collections
have problems now and then.
One problem is too many. I want
everything vetted once and for all.
- <i>Everything?
- Everything!</i>
- <i>We have the exhibition...
- all of it!</i>
<i>- I want it inspected and re-certified.
- Everything!</i>
<i>You... get...</i>
<i>This is your first trip to ghorman.</i>
<i>As a fashion designer,
it's a rite of passage.</i>
<i>You've lived in the same
place for the last five years.</i>
<i>51457, level 4888,
east narcene, Coruscant.</i>
<i>51457, level 4888,
east narcene, Coruscant.</i>
<i>It's a small unit, but it's
above your design studio</i>
<i>where you do most of your work.</i>
There was a...
Listening device...
In my office.
How long it's been there, or if
it's even operational are unknown.
You will all now have the
pleasure of thorough isb interview,
and there will be new security
measures going forward.
Because, of course...
We're bugging our own office!
Hello.
- We were worried.
- You seem upset.
We saw isb come into the building.
Yes. Yes, I am... upset.
They tore my office apart.
I was interrogated for
two hours like a criminal.
For coming to the meeting?
No... no, no. It's nothing
to do with that. They were...
They were looking
for a listening device...
Which, of course, I either
condoned or ignored,
or put in myself for some reason.
Or else the whole thing was a
ruse for them to put something in.
I don't know. They...
They do what they want.
- Without explanation?
- It's the isb.
They have their own
rules. No one else matters.
A lesson for all of us.
It's humiliating.
I take my work seriously.
It's outrageous.
Many of us believe the emperor has
no idea what's being done on his behalf.
We think the isb is running
a shadow government.
To be honest, nothing would
surprise me at this point.
And believe me, you
don't know the half of it.
What if we could help the
empire by working together?
How would we do that?
We need to know
what's on those carriers.
You know who we are and
you see what's happening here.
We need to know what kind of facility
it is before things get out of hand.
I told you. I don't have plans.
We want to focus on deliveries.
We need to know what's
on those transports, syril.
It's... construction material.
That's what comes across my desk.
- And the rest of it?
- Not every transport has a bill of lading.
Those are the ones we'd be interested in.
No.
No, no. Not that.
He's fine. He'll be home soon enough.
I came to see about you.
Here I am.
This old place.
Not many safe houses have a view.
- You want a drink?
- No, I can't stay that long.
This isn't fun, is it?
The nights are fun.
I've slept here twice.
Not in a very long time, but... For fun?
No. False alarm.
Never ends, does it?
All the hiding.
It will. We'll bring them
down, or die trying.
What else is there?
I'm not as strong as you.
That's just tonight talking.
That's being stuck here in this box.
Or maybe you're not as strong as I think.
Maybe not.
I'll try to find someplace else
for you to stay. I'll have a look.
I'm not loving Coruscant.
It's overwhelming. I know you...
You've been struggling.
Is that what he told you?
I'm better than he thinks I am.
All he does is sing your praises.
We need you, bix. We need you healthy.
You came here to offer me something.
You wanted something.
And you changed your mind.
Not lost your eye, have you? It
was just another weapons appraisal.
I have alternatives. We'll
find something more exciting.
You should rest. You should
be here when he gets back.
Give it.
I use it for sleep.
It works for a while.
But the dreams come
back worse when you stop.
Be careful.
You need me healthy.
Yeah.
Variation five... So that's thirds...
Watch the line.
Take your time.
Be sure.
Careful.
One to the right.
And we're all dead.
We're doing station five, right?
Well, if you close the pipe completely,
- it'll spark when it comes back on.
- I knew that. I knew that. I'm an idiot.
It's right here.
Well, it's a lot to take in.
It doesn't seem to bother you.
Eight variations. Saw thinks there's
eight things I have to remember.
He doesn't realize all the primes,
all the sifting factors, the tools...
How did you ever learn
this? Who taught you?
No more questions. Sorry.
I can't leave until you get this.
Come on.
Mid sift, variation two.
- What time's your flight?
- I'll make it.
I'm just backing up all
our transport schedules.
I'd hate to think what would happen
if those isb idiots hit the wrong button.
- We can do that for you.
- Just get the audit back on track.
Make sure to lock up tight.
I don't want any more security questions.
Yes, sir.
Traveling, are we?
Something to take home?
Yeah, I'll take one for my mother.
Well, you'll want a good one.
We're fine. Nobody's watching.
Man of taste. Best spider
on the Plaza. Come back safe.
Thank you.
Yes...
Thank you.
We were wondering if we should offer it
up to sculdun as a gift for the exhibition.
It's short notice but
if there was interest,
we might find time for
an immediate installation.
It's remarkable, yes,
but, um, between us? I wouldn't do it.
There's been some question about
the provenance of a certain piece
nothing to do with luthen,
but sculdun is in a rage about it
and they are taking
everything out of there
the day after the party for re-appraisal.
{\an8}"Military security required."
Thank you.
Checking in?
Varian Skye.
Holo-screen, air flow and window blinds,
they all work through the
single console on the nightstand.
Is that where it happened?
The monument?
It is.
Really?
Wow. Right there.
Some people don't think it's a good idea
to commemorate a
massacre in the center of town.
- Is that you?
- Do I mind?
Yeah.
No. Doesn't matter to me.
I'm sure you have an opinion.
I needn't be reminded. I was there.
How old were you?
Twelve.
Grand moff tarkin, right?
Will there be anything else, sir?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.
Here, thank you.
We've been asked not
to speak of it with guests.
I'm just a designer.
I'm curious.
I've been hearing about
ghorman my whole life.
It was moff tarkin.
People wouldn't clear
and he wanted to land...
And more of us kept coming.
We thought there
was safety in numbers.
Who would land a cruiser on a crowd
full of unarmed citizens?
I was with my father.
He was killed saving me.
Sorry to hear that.
Haven't gone very far, have I?
My wife thinks it's insane we stay here.
Do let me know if there's
anything else you might need.
Hey.
Thank you.
It's good to meet you.
I was safe.
I was careful all the way.
I know. I had you followed.
Partagaz insisted.
- How long can I stay?
- An hour.
Are you kidding?
Do you think they're really
watching eedy's apartment?
No. But we've put too much in now
to have it go wrong
for something so small.
An hour.
Turn out the lights.
Can't believe you had me followed.
Turn out the lights.
Varian Skye?
Yes.
- Enza. The house of rylanz.
- Enza!
You've just arrived.
Yeah. Yeah.
Already out and about? How intrepid.
And you... how observant.
Well, the times demand
it, don't you think?
I was planning to make
an appointment tomorrow
and here you are.
- May I?
- Yes, please.
How timely.
You're a designer?
Trying.
This cafe used to be full of designers...
And weavers and buyers.
People fought for tables.
Look at us now.
Is your hotel even half full?
I just checked in.
I happen to know it's not.
What is it you think you're doing?
You don't know me.
Let's start over.
My friend suggested I meet your father.
Your friend might have come himself.
Unless, I'm the friend, right?
Or maybe I'm a snitch,
and you're my payday.
Maybe I'm isb.
Maybe you just put everyone
you care about into a cell.
I am who you want me to be,
but that's just you getting lucky.
People die rushing.
You have no idea who I am.
You need to be more careful.
It's hard to be patient when
your world is falling apart.
My father's very proud.
And I can't wait to meet him.
I need fabric.
When is a good time for me to
come by the showroom tomorrow?
I'll, send word in the morning.
Thanks for stopping by.
Hey, the people you have following
me, they're just drawing attention.
Send them home.
Nice to meet you.
Open.
Does it have a name?
It's your spider.
Perhaps I'll call it "syril."
That's an interesting choice.
What a comfort that will be.
The silence.
The brooding.
The disregard for common sense.
Be almost like having you here.
<i>Welcome back to good
morning, Coruscant!</i>
<i>It's that time of the year, toffi!</i>
<i>Senate investiture. I
absolutely adore this holiday.</i>
<i>I know you wanna talk
about the politics of it all.</i>
<i>- I do.
- I want to talk parties.</i>
<i>- Political parties?
- No!</i>
<i>It's vesty week!</i>
<i>I wanna know who's

<i>I wanna talk clothes. I wanna
know where you've been invited.</i>

- Well, it's true.</i>
<i>That's why you, dear viewers,
will be getting the inside story</i>
<i>from the hottest ticket in town.</i>
<i>Don't say she doesn't give you anything.</i>
<i>The time of selflessness.</i>
Welcome to the house of rylanz.
My pleasure.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
Please.
Varian Skye.
Carro rylanz. Welcome to ghorman.
I've waited far too long in
coming. Your showroom is fantastic.
Nineteen generations.
One of the youngest twilleries in palmo.
Amazing. Amazing.
Our webberie estates are quite far away,
but they are certainly worth
a visit if you find the time.
Can I show you?
I've been told about your
conversation last night.
Apparently, we have a lot to learn.
Is it safe to talk in here?
We sweep for listening devices daily.
That must draw attention.
Every twillery on the Plaza does
the same. It's a competitive market.
There was a rebel pilot
trapped in the mountains.
We saved him.
You were given a special radio.
The person that sent
you is but a voice to me.
We've spoken, we've
exchanged messages,
but I have no idea, really,
who's at the other end of the line.
That won't change. But
it's for everyone's benefit.
I do have this.
It's a fresh code-crystal for the radio.
It's one-of-a-kind.
It will only fit the
transmitter you were given.
I offer that as a bond.
The new imperial
building. You've seen it?
Well, it's hard to miss.
- They're building an armory.
- In the center of town?
We don't know why. They deny it.
It's in violation of the imperial charter.
We've had sightings. We've slipped
people into some of the work crews,
but we were unsure until now.
I'm only meeting you because we
find ourselves with a unique opportunity.
We have a source inside.
- An imperial source?
- I'll not say.
Feeding false
information is what they do.
You're aware of that?
They're... they're pretty good at it.
The information is reliable.
Shipments come by
cargo-carrier from the south depot
at night through the city.
We've been tracking
the routes and schedules.
Now we know which transports to target.
The ones you think have weapons.
We know what they are
doing. Now we need proof.
What do you mean by "target"?
Take it. Take it down.
We need to catch them in their lie.
We need to let the people of
ghorman know the undeniable truth.
What about the weapons?
We start our own armory.
Ever done anything like this before?
Steal?
It's a military transport.
It won't be easy.
Quiet, both of you.
Tactical expertise is not our strong suit.
We need an advisor.
I'm gonna need some
swatches sent over.
You're gonna want to check the radio.
And, if everything is fine,
I would love to get a
tour of palmo by night.
- You can call for me at the hotel.
- As you wish.
Thank you.
You're convinced we're connecting
to the ghorman front leadership?
I am, sir.
Carro rylanz is a prominent
businessman and politician in palmo.
I've been dealing with him directly.
And we're sure they're buying this story?
We're skeptically confident, sir.
Words to live by.
I think they're planning already.
They're inexperienced but very eager.
How often those attributes align.
They'll need help, sir.
The plan... your plan to bait
ghorman as a prize for outside agitators
needs to begin somewhere.
This could be that moment.
How may we assist?
Transport schedules
need to remain consistent.
The information I pass
them needs to be accurate.
I'll need oversight on military security.
- Done.
- If they pull it off,
when it's over, we need to
calibrate retribution carefully.
We want them growing bolder.
They need to see what winning feels like.
I'll make sure things
don't get out of hand.
Excellent work, syril.
Thank you, sir.
We'll keep you briefed.
If I say this is the
greatest day of my life...
Does it spoil everything?
It's good to see you happy.
I know all the variations, in
theory. I just need more practice.
So we can lose the boy?
He's seen too much.
If you're ready, then I'll get rid of him.
He's a good engineer.
A great one, maybe.
- But we have you!
- What about the people who sent him?
Accidents happen.
I was hoping he could come along.
You lack confidence, pluti.
Until you tell me the station we're
hitting, this is gonna be on edge.
The number of variations I'm
carrying right now is driving me crazy.
If I could focus on one
single variation, one,
I'd have the confidence
you're looking for.
Markez moon. Neen valley.
Station four junction.
We leave tomorrow night.
Tubes has all of the pipe numbers.
Thank you.
Wilmon?
We'll keep him for now.
The tinian codex in
sculdun's office collection.
What about it?
What have you heard?
I need some good news.
You'll have to wait on that.
There's another piece.
The coryio chalice.
Apparently, it's a forgery.
They're going to examine
everything in the collection.
They'll find our microphone.
You heard this on the bug?
They're taking everything
out the day after the party.
They never send more
than three at a time.
The ones we're interested
in always travel alone.
Thirty meters down, we
have a transport waiting.
We slide the cargo to
the bottom and disappear.
- Let's keep making avoidable mistakes.
- Let's keep overreacting.
I wouldn't be so upset
if I hadn't predicted it!
This solves nothing.
- And for what? What have we ever heard?
- Are you done?
"Let's put a bug in davo sculdun's
office that leads directly back to us."
It didn't seem to bother you
when we caught yularen lying.
- Seriously.
- The holo-news buyout.
Sculdun courting the grand vizier!
Bits and pieces. That's all we ever got.
- Two years of bits and pieces!
- You agreed to it!
- I let you talk me into it!
- You're becoming insufferable!
I can't keep track anymore!
All these lines we've
laid. All this information.
The radios, the frequencies,
the messages flying around!
We're drowning.
And you keep pretending
it's all under control.
Are you done?
We have to take it out at the party.
And if we can't?
We should be prepared.
- Is he ready?
- Yes.
Ready enough to do it on
his own? No help from you?
I think so.
You think
or you know?
It's "neither." I've done what I can.
I've done everything you've asked for.
And if I don't show up back home, there
traitor!
- What happened?
- He's a traitor.
Show them!
He's been transmitting to the empire.
What?
There's an ambush waiting for
us at the markez moon pipeline.
But we... We will be many parsecs away
drinking our rhydo in peace.
Move quickly, comrades.
Whatever you don't take, we burn.
We will not be back this way again.
It's on you, boy.
So...
Are you running away or
running to find us reinforcements?
That won't be up to me.
Surely you have an opinion.
Hijacking the carrier?
Yes, can be done.
But can you and your people do it alone?
I don't think so.
How much help do we need?
It's not stealing things that's difficult.
It's getting away.
But you won't be doing that.
You'll be living at the scene of the crime.
Worse than that... You're planning
to advertise what you've done.
So then what?
Let it continue?
Let them build what they want?
Let them persecute us for no reason
and tighten the noose
every time we cry out?
Is that what you suggest?
Is that truly your recommendation?
I have more questions
than recommendations.
Not much of a revolutionary, are you?
Perhaps not.
Good day to you.
And tell your friend I'm not impressed.
I was younger than you are now.
I was a prisoner.
They made a work camp in the jungle.
No droids, no beasts,
just men and cargo.
Onderon jungle.
Real jungle.
Hot, wet, blistering jungle.
Old men died fast.
Just dropped where they stood.
We came back the next day,
there'd be nothing but a bone
or two where they went down.
Our clothes, just... just melted away.
So they worked us naked.
Two, three hundred men.
Boys, really.
Back and forth until the only thing
you could remember was back and forth.
Then one day, everyone started to itch.
Everyone, all at once.
Even the guards.
You could feel your skin coming alive.
It was the rhydo.
They had a leak.
You could feel it
before you could smell it.
So they all panicked and ran away...
But it was new to me.
It's done.
I'm gonna open the valve now.
I have always loved you.
What are you doing?
- There it is.
- How can you do that?
Because I understand it.
Because she's my sister
rhydo, and she loves me!
That itch, that burn...
You feel how badly
she wants to explode?
Remember this.
Remember this moment!
This perfect night.
You think I'm crazy?
Yes, I am.
Revolution is not for the sane.
Look at us.
Unloved.
Hunted.
Cannon fodder.
We'll all be dead before
the republic is back
and yet... here we are.
Where are you, boy?
You're here! You're not
with luthen. You're here!
You're right here, and
you're ready to fight!
We're the rhydo, kid. We're the fuel.
We're the thing that explodes when
there's too much friction in the air.
Let it in, boy! That's freedom calling!
Let it in. Let it run!
Let it run wild!

﻿1
It's that time of the year, toffi!
Senate investiture. I
absolutely adore this holiday.
I want to talk parties.
I wanna know who's
going where with who.
I wanna know where you've been invited.
Dedra meero is running ghorman.
She's been on it all year.
All this time. Hiding it.
What's the obsession with ghorman?
- What are they after?
- I don't know.
I'm trying to rethink this all with her
in the picture. It doesn't make sense.
I need an assessment. Carro rylanz.
He's running the ghorman
front. I'm not sure about the group.
And bix?
No. You'd have to go alone.
I'm not loving Coruscant.
It's overwhelming. I know you...
You've been struggling.
- No! No! No!
- Hey.
We need you, bix. We need you healthy.
No word from your friend?
Cinta? No.
Luthen knows but he won't tell me.
That's not acceptable.
If she wanted to see me, she would.
I'm only meeting you
because we find ourselves
with a unique opportunity.
We have a source inside.
- An imperial source?
- I'll not say.
Feeding false
information is what they do.
They're pretty good at it.
The information is reliable.
They'll need help, sir.
How may we assist?
Transport schedules
need to remain consistent.
The information I pass
them needs to be accurate.
Done.
Let it continue? Let them
build what they want?
Is that truly your recommendation?
I have more questions
than recommendations.
Not much of a revolutionary, are you?
It's a forgery.
What else have we missed?
Even the finest collections
have problems now and then.
"Let's put a bug in davo sculdun's
office that leads directly back to us."
You agreed to it!
We're drowning.
And you keep pretending
it's all under control.
We have to take it out at the party.
And if we can't?
We should be prepared.
- You're late.
- Yeah.
We had a spot inspection
coming out of ghorman.
Preflight check complete.
Hold on.
Set for Coruscant.
Calculating for Coruscant.
Calculation complete.
Look at you.
What's his name?
Varian Skye.
Not bad.
Tell me about the ghorman
front. You weren't there very long.
Don't get involved.
That's your assessment? Just like that.
Two days in. You barely looked around.
How do you know what I did?
We heard it didn't go very well.
You heard? Really? I
only left this morning.
Well, they sent word. They're
very prompt, the ghormans.
What they are is impatient.
They started too late.
Now they're rushing.
That's awfully definitive.
They're not ready, luthen.
I think they know that.
That's why we sent you.
The empire is building an
armory in the center of town.
They say it's a new complex
office, but everyone knows the truth.
There's nothing to be done about it now,
and the more trouble they
make, the worse it will be.
- There's always something to be done.
- Yeah?
Yeah? They have a plan.
They want to hijack an imperial transport
to prove something that
everybody already knows is true.
Who's gonna care about it?
The empire will care about it.
Exactly.
In a place where they know nothing
about fighting. They'll be crushed.
They're finally wanting to do
something and you tell them to be careful.
It doesn't matter to you, does it?
It doesn't matter? Ghorman in play?
A new front line against the empire?
The chance for that? That's a triumph.
You're thinking small.
You're thinking like a thief.
I'm thinking like a soldier.
Think like a leader.
Think about a planet
like ghorman in rebellion.
A planet of wealth and status.
And... if it goes up in flames?
It will burn... very brightly.
I'll skip this one.
Will you excuse me a moment?
Yes?
Waste of time. This
piece isn't what we need.
We knew that already.
I thought seeing it in person
would make a difference.
I have a customer waiting.
You were sourcing another item.
It's being delivered as we speak.
Visiting friends?
- Why do you ask?
- I'm curious by nature.
I have friends everywhere.
I had a feeling you were on your way.
Hi.
Look at this place.
You cleaned it up.
We're here. Might as well.
Yeah. The flowers...
They're expensive. But they are beautiful.
The trip? Okay?
Different.
Who were you?
I was varian Skye.
I was a fashion designer.
Yeah.
I was very, very pretty.
I'm sorry I missed that.
Fresh blue suit.
Coruscanti shirt.
Polished shoes.
Just your kinda guy.
Well, you're gonna have to
bring him home some night.
You... you must be hungry.
Hey.
You okay?
Was it dangerous?
Ghorman? No.
Just... all talk. A waste of time.
It's luthen that scared me.
Yeah. Tell me about it.
He came after you left.
I didn't realize how
shabby the place looked.
What? He came?
Yeah, he was gonna ask
me for a weapons appraisal
but he changed his mind.
Go out? On your own?
He waits... he waits for me to
leave? He comes when you're alone?
He changed his mind, so
I rode back with him this
afternoon, he never mentioned it.
- It happened.
- I know it happened, bix.
That... that's not what I'm saying.
What is that?
He knows you need a rest.
- I would have gone if he asked.
- That's not the point.
He's so pissed off,
he's not gonna tell me?
He has to know we're
having this conversation.
He doesn't do anything without a reason.
Maybe he just wants us to
waste our time talking about it.
Maybe.
That leaves senator rhodi,
senator plada, danascar,
we can't possibly make them all...
If we... if we skip the girvan banquet,
then we could just about
make the whole night work.
And we can't leave sculdun's early.
No, no, no. We'll finish there.
Why so difficult this
season? You never struggle.
It's these dinners.
I mean, how many years did you
serve before we held a ceremony dinner?
I count eighty. Eighty new senators,
all hosting "investiture banquets."
It's tough squeezing a whole year's
worth of insincerity into three nights.
You'll figure it out.
This was a very poor decision.
You come to the house
and you mess with bix?
You mess with her behind my back?
You realize what you're
putting at risk right now?
It would have been so
easy for you to tell me.
When you leave here,
and that will be immediately,
you'll have brought a medallion
that was missing from a shipment
that kleya took this
afternoon. A darvian medallion.
So, thank you for this.
Coming all this way.
What's wrong with you?
This is the second time
today you let me down.
You had to know she would tell me.
I thought it would be
interesting if she didn't,
but now you've both disappointed me.
And that's what's most important, right?
- How it goes for you!
- What's most important is the cause!
"Kill me or take me in."
You're in!
"But ghorman looks too
painful. Bix is too vulnerable."
- I give you everything.
- This is everything?
This fury? This lack of control?
Violating every protocol we live by?
Soft on ghorman but willing
to protect bix at any cost.
We... we are not droids, luthen.
We are not who we
were when we started.
Bix has to pull it together.
Or you will have to decide at what
point it becomes too large a problem.
Unless that's what
you're doing right now.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's gonna be up to you.
I want her as strong as you do.
It would just be easier if I was alone.
I came with you to be part of something.
You want my blood?
You help me work this out.
Thank you for the medallion.
Coming all this way.
Morning, gentlemen.
Just who I wanted to
see. Save us all a meeting.
Dr. Gorst. Success invites scrutiny.
Our cousins in military
intelligence have been salivating
over our interrogation results
and have convinced the emperor
that Dr. Gorst is too valuable
to be a one-man, isb asset.
He's to be expanded into a program.
Sorry to hear that, sir.
The Navy's donated a
facility here in Coruscant.
I want the two of you to
represent our interests in this.
I'm counting on you to
keep watch on these idiots.
An honor, sir.
Really?
It's an assignment.
Calibrate your enthusiasm.
Yes, sir.
We'll have a brief sent down.
You're taking the lead on this.
Why did I say that?
- Fill me in after you've read the brief.
- What?
Any trouble getting through?
It was easy.
My hair.
I like it.
I forget about it.
The gear?
The kid took it.
- Do you know where it's going?
- It's not far.
Thought we should meet first.
I was told they don't
know what they are doing.
That's why we're not doing much.
It's fast, it's simple.
You brought the fuses?
More than enough.
We get a look at it tonight?
And the crew. Whole thing.
If we don't like it, we walk.
I told luthen that I would only take
this assignment if you were on it.
You're the only reason I'm here.
I had an accident.
I told him not to tell
you. I knew you'd worry.
What happened?
I'll tell you about it someday.
It's been a long year.
I had to rest up for a while.
Quite a while.
I had time to think.
Wish I'd known.
I thought about you.
Can I help you?
Um, I'll have what she's having.
- Our friend in ghorman?
- He's just reached out, sir.
There's an isb field agent on-site.
They believe a rebel attack is imminent.
There's been a rapid
increase in local activity.
- And the shipments are running smoothly?
- Yes, sir.
You walk a very narrow path, dedra.
Syril must never know
what this is all really about.
I remind myself constantly, sir.
What's the fastest they could get here?
Eight minutes. And
we can slow them down.
Let's call it six minutes.
That's six minutes from
the moment we go loud.
Time's up.
We leave with what we
have. We don't get greedy.
We need all the weapons we can get.
We're not just here to make a point.
Some of us want to protect ourselves.
Don't.
- "Don't" what?
- Don't talk.
Don't think.
Do as you are told.
If you can't manage that,
you don't belong here.
The staging area feels right.
There should be just enough
time between the transports
to do what we need to do.
Tell me about the neighborhood.
Three families here.
Another two at the back.
- Both with children.
- This building is empty at night.
But there is five units here,
two in front, three at the alley.
Do we control these rooftops?
Most of them.
And we can always lock a few doors.
Fine. Let's talk about the back end.
Every person in this room needs
at least two alternative exit plans.
Down below, you're
driving the transport, right?
That's our ride out.
You're the end of our line.
Which means you do not
move under any circumstances
until you are told to do so.
By who? By you?
I live here. We've put a lot into this.
Your time means nothing.
Prep is useless if you can't follow orders.
You ready?
It's not so hard.
Show me.
It's a good plan.
You've picked the right spot.
Nobody needs weapons.
Everyone has a way out.
But right now, it is just a plan.
We're here because you've
never done anything like this.
I can't stress this enough.
You're all going to need to
respect the chain of command.
Cinta and I will have
blasters. Nobody else.
And I mean nobody.
We will drop the carrier.
We'll drop it and cover
you for six minutes after that.
But we do not go
unless everyone here agrees to
do exactly as they've been told.
If that's not possible, this
would be the time to say so.
- You mean, now?
- Right now.
When are you planning to do this?
Tomorrow night.
Intelligence gets stale.
You might be too late already.
Tomorrow it is.
Bix?
It's flashing.
Whatever the mission is, I'm coming.
Do you hear me?
Hey. Hey.
You'll come with me.
What do you think?
Well, they're not stupid.
We have the trigger.
If it doesn't feel right, we'll walk away.
The driver, dreena...
She should be up top with us.
Did she say something else?
Just a feeling.
They must have another driver.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I was...
Confused.
I don't know who I am sometimes.
I'm not perfect either.
You make yourself change.
I've never done that.
Luthen should have told
me you were in trouble.
I wasn't thinking clearly.
All the more reason.
He shouldn't have let you say no.
He should have told me.
We're worth more to him
separately than together.
Well, that's something we'll
have to talk to him about.
Upon my life and honor...
Life and honor...
For the peace and bounty of all beings...
Peace and bounty... My full allegiance...
Full allegiance... A galaxy of worlds...
A galaxy of worlds...
A galaxy assembled...
A galaxy assembled... An empire!
Driver's here.
Senator mothma.
Senator organ a.
- Perrin.
- Bail. How are you?
I'm free. That was my last
investiture party of the season.
Don't tell me you've left
poor breha up there all alone.
No, we had to split up to cover
the rounds. I drew sculdun.
- Yes. We almost did that. But...
- not tonight.
No, you're family now.
You're in for the show. Good luck with it.
This is an imperial security protocol.
I need all personnel
to exit the control center
immediately for security reasons.
Let's go.
Apologies for any inconvenience.
Senator mothma, over here!
- There you are. Party trail refugees.
- We made it.
Took us long enough.
Have you spoken to the
children since they've been back?
- We must.
- We must absolutely.
When the festivities are over.
Thank you, senator mothma.
They're just setting up now.
Are we on schedule with
the targeted shipment?
Yes, sir. We're all set here.
- How do they seem?
- They're on time.
Be careful in that tunnel.
Pre-carvian. Third millennium.
It's a good guess.
The stone is carvian,
but it's older, isn't it?
We think it's lost empire.
My word, luthen. And you wear it out?
I thought one of you thieves
might make me an offer.
It takes one to know one, luthen.
I don't know what to do, kleya.
I am sick about this forgery.
- I'm sorry.
- Sculdun's been relentless.
Yeah, I'm sure.
You haven't told luthen about
the reappraisals, have you?
No, I promised, didn't I?
- Yeah, sorry...
- Don't worry.
This is actually better than my fantasy.
Soak it up. We'll never
be back here again.
Speak for yourself.
How did you two get in here?
We come every year.
Partagaz had an emergency
and tossed us the invites.
- Where's your buddy?
- He'll be here.
What are we drinking?
Kali coolers, and they're amazing.
This is my third one.
Dispatch confirmed. We're in the queue.
Repeat, we're up next.
Everyone take your
positions and be ready.
Thank you.
A new season of legislative initiative.
How thrilling.
Always looking on the bright side.
I haven't heard from my cousin.
She's probably just being careful.
Well, tell her to check in with me.
Something urgent she needs knowing?
Yes. I care about her.
Showtime. The sculdun collection awaits.
We're discreetly gathering the chosen.
What fun. I just happen to
have my history teacher with me.
Yeah, we're coming, we're
coming. We'll see you there.
Lonni.
Perhaps you remember me. Kleya.
You came by the shop to
find something for your wife.
- What are you doing here?
- We had a fascinating conversation.
Your friends will think we're flirting.
There's no harm in that, is there?
Are you out of your mind?
Do as I say and everything will be fine.
Target is en route.
We always like to feature something
fresh to the collection up front,
and this is our latest addition.
And the miracle man who helped
secure this very special piece
is actually here with us tonight.
Director krennic, luthen rael.
What a pleasure.
How kind you are.
Senator mothma, perrin fertha,
I'm sure you've met before.
Yes. I've been a guest at her
committee on several occasions.
How pleasant to see you
free of the witness stand.
What a festive evening this has become.
So, tell me what we're looking at.
Yes. The lost tairn. This
is a very rare, special piece
we're very lucky to have acquired.
I'm showing you something special.
Is it from carmeen?
Do you have any idea
who's in this room right now?
You're not smiling.
This is suicide.
It's my favorite object in the collection.
I was heartbroken when we sold it.
Luthen will tell them that's why
I'm so keen on visiting with it.
They've done it. The carrier's down.
Repeat, the carrier is down.
We're in play.
There's only three like it that we know of.
This... this is the one
that was left behind
during the battle of carmeen.
There's a stone carving that
depicts three identical tairns
mounted on the altar of the
grand carmeenian forest...
- Isn't it beautiful?
- You're risking everything.
Move slightly to your left.
Tell me what you're doing.
I'm removing a listening
device from this piece
and you're going to help
me by blocking the view.
You can't possibly be serious.
The tinian codex was
forged 2000 years ago
on a planet where sight
was considered a disability.
And what were you
gonna do if I wasn't here?
Anything I had to.
This is do-or-die, lonni,
so move to your left,
and listen closely
because we may be tested.
That's a great story.
Go.
That one, open.
We're good, move.
We're good.
This piece will eventually,
as my greed subsides
join its sisters in the whole of history.
We'll make an event of it.
Don't rush. Smooth is faster.
There's a bit of a theme
on this side of the gallery.
There's a carmeenian helmet.
It's a few centuries
after the grand conflict.
We studied the battle of
carmeen at the isb academy.
Well, it wasn't much of a battle, was it?
No, how right you are... Tinians believed
all language could be reduced to touch.
Their skin was so sensitive.
Very few carmeenians
lived to tell the tale.
You know how it is.
Insurgencies have a long
history of puffing up their failures.
We were taught it was
a systematic execution.
Well, that is exactly my point.
Criminals love to lie.
After all, who wants to
die for "lawless ineptitude"?
Well... How much longer?
It's stuck.
They're offloading.
I count at least six.
They're using the spillway
tunnels. They're moving quickly.
The shedian word for
"memory" is almost identical
to their word for "revenge"...
What are you doing?
- Shift right.
- They're almost here.
I'm walking away.
Do as I say.
Was meant to be a cathartic
curse written into the stone.
Zippe, zippe, zippe!
You seem fixated on defining
people by their resistance to power.
Words do still have meaning.
As I'm sure we can still agree on that.
What's the word for
people like the carmeen
who simply wish to be left alone?
Vulnerable.
What's the word for people
who skin trespassers alive?
- Is that what they did?
- It was a very long time ago.
Well, they had their
own code of conduct.
My rebel is your terrorist.
Something like that?
What a swell party this is.
Let us continue.
- Put both hands on top.
- Why?
Hold it steady.
One minute warning.
Have you seen dreena?
Let's go. Last few boxes.
- She's not here.
- She wandered off.
- We're not waiting.
- We have a minute.
I'll clean up the fuses.
Help them finish.
Okay, let's wrap it up. We're leaving now.
This piece was just laying in
plain sight. Totally unrecognized.
Not as a cloak rack, but as a
ballast for a swamp freighter.
Shots fired.
One shot.
No. No.
I can't see it from here.
- I can't move.
- Never mind that.
Call the response team.
And come in loud, make sure
they know we're on the way.
Jacquème! Jacquème! Lo stique sassor!
Nache mik balor! Sim ro nache telpó!
Hey, you need to stand, we
have to move. Look at me.
I... I need help.
We have to go, okay? We have to go.
I can take her. I can take her.
Tinian codex...
Isn't it lovely?
I understand that this piece is...
It's a favorite of yours.
It's very special.
Why?
It's a book.
You read by touch, your hand.
It's from a planet where
blindness was considered a gift.
Well, I'm sure we can
all think of some people
who would be right at home.
Feel free to touch.
I often find myself wandering
by and closing my eyes...
To wonder at another world.
Come on. We have to go.
Are you crying?
Are you?
Look at me.
Look at me!
There's no place to hide. Look at me.
I'm not going to say "remember
this," because I don't have to.
This is on you now.
This is like skin.
You're taking her with you wherever
you go for the rest of your useless life.
Don't you look away from me.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- She was a warrior.
She was everything that
you have daydreamed about.
She was a blooded, fearless warrior
whose loss will be mourned in
ways that you will never understand.
She was a miracle.
And you...
To die like this because of you...
Some whining, simpering, foolish child.
Don't you dare cry.
You'll make up for this forever.
What fun.
You're welcome.
My face hurts from smiling.
Complain all you like, it worked.
We should have killed
krennic while we were up there.
That's the spirit.
Get in the chair.
- I know you.
- Get in the chair!
How do I know
it will only feel like forever.
Hey! Who are you?
Nobody's allowed in here.

﻿1
Revolution is not for the sane.
<i>And yet... here we are.</i>
<i>Where are you, boy?</i>
You're here! You're not
with luthen. You're here!
You're right here, and
you're ready to fight!
Spiders are not the most
unique thing in ghorman.
There's a mineral underground. Doctor!
Deep substrate foliated kalkite.
Should we fail to find any alternatives,
we will have to control
ghorman with a hand firm enough
to silence any resistance.
Grand moff tarkin killed 500
peaceful, unarmed ghormans
<i>in the middle of that Plaza.</i>
You can imagine how
upset we would be to find out
there's an imperial military facility
rising over the monument to the fallen.
Is that where it happened?
I was with my father.
He was killed saving me.
I can't support the bill because
I can't risk chafing the emperor.
Why ghorman is being
persecuted so intently
are questions no one
seems prepared to answer.
Hasn't there always been something
slightly arrogant about the ghor?
With the right ideas planted in the
right markets in the right sequence,
we can now weaponize
this galactic opinion.
<i>Propaganda will only get you so far.</i>
You need a radical
insurgency you can count on.
You need ghorman rebels you
can depend on to do the wrong thing.
Luthen should have told
me you were in trouble.
We're worth more to him
separately than together.
Well, that's something we'll
have to talk to him about.
- Jacquème! Jacquème!
- Lo stique sassor!
<i>Nache mik balor! Sim ro nache telpó!</i>
I'm not loving Coruscant.
It's overwhelming, I know you...
You've been struggling.
You come to the house
and you mess with bix?
You mess with her behind my back?
You realize what you're
putting at risk right now?
- I give you everything.
- This is everything?
Violating every protocol we live by?
<i>Bix has to pull it together.</i>
Or you<i> Will have to decide at what
point it becomes too large a problem.</i>
Whatever the mission is, I'm coming.
Shadow-six, you are
clear for open pad one.
Go for tower, 0-1-1.
Listen up! New rules!
No vouchers, no food, no rack until
you check in with your duty officer.
You'll find your duty officer
listed on the health certificate
waiting for you in the clinic
following your medical approval.
Stay to the group and
mind the freight paths.
Take your shirt off.
And don't tell me it's better.
- Turn around.
- I'm gonna be late.
What's more important?
Easy. Easy.
That was easy.
- Pick another spot.
- Just relax.
Yeah? What are you gonna do?
Anything I want.
Hey.
Look at this.
- I can come back.
- Don't you dare.
I was about to send a search party.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- When did you get back?
- Just now.
- Where have you been?
- I was on a repair.
It took a while getting back.
- You check in?
- Not yet.
Things are getting really
organized around here.
Tell me about it.
- Here.
- That's all right. I've got it. Thanks.
Back from where?
- Here and there.
- This is here.
I'm asking you where you were.
He just got in.
She's been more worried
about you than I have.
Thanks.
Where were you?
Luthen wants to know
if you're ready to work.
Ready for what?
He knows you were hurt.
If he does, it's because you told him.
He's been trying to reach you.
Ready for what?
He just wants to know
if he can count on you.
- Well, he's not making it easy.
- Whose fault is that?
You trust this place? All these people?
New faces every day?
We need an army.
Everything's a risk.
All we do here is get ready.
Luthen is making things happen.
Is he?
What do you want, wil?
You wanna fight?
Or you wanna win?
Going it alone doesn't cut it anymore.
Well, maybe you should tell him yourself.
Maybe you should tell
us where you've been.
The continued and
inexplicable ghorman resistance
to imperial norms.
Terrorism strikes again in ghorman.
Just three weeks after
events in corei and jel-novi,
there was a firebombing last
night at the naval terminal in palmo.
You can see, behind me,
vapor and thermal smoke
still rising from the site...
The number of imperial
casualties is still unknown.
Admiral tyzen is expected
to comment later today,
but we've already seen
an escalated response level.
Curfew was reinstated for the entire city.
Local leaders are urging calm,
and so far, there's been no
statement, or claim of credit,
from any local terrorist groups.
You can feel this city,
which was already on edge these
past few months, tightening up...
Ghorman? For luthen?
All these side runs. That's
what you've been doing?
It's being destroyed.
He must be thrilled.
He's wanted it long enough.
Dragging you out there? For what?
Help him torch the place?
It's not like that.
Not now.
It's the empire with the
torches. They've gone insane.
So?
What does he need me for?
Her.
Isb supervisor, dedra meero.
She destroyed ferrix.
She killed my father.
You know her.
She's there in ghorman.
In the open, I've seen her.
She's there now, and she's
there waiting to be killed,
and I know you're gonna
say it's for revenge, but it's not.
She's been coming
for luthen since ferrix.
She's been coming after him,
and you, and all of us,
and everyone we know.
She's just sitting there, cass.
She keeps winning.
You know she has to be stopped!
I'm late for my briefing.
You need to calm down, and check in.
You act like luthen's the enemy.
That would be easier.
She's a monster.
We won't have a better chance.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
<i>The emperor has taken a
great interest in the situation.</i>
Director krennic's still with him now,
but they wanted me to pass along the
affirmative message to you immediately.
<i>We are moving forward
with the original plan.</i>
There is, apparently,
no suitable replacement
or synthetic alternative for
the ghorman substrate material.
I see.
It's not for lack of effort.
Krennic's had the lab in
eadu working overtime all year.
I don't know the science, but...
It's bad luck ghorman.
<i>We need what's in the
ground, and when we're done,</i>
<i>there won't be much left to call "home."</i>
When?
The fleet will be fully
positioned in 48 hours.
<i>They're fiddling with the calendar,</i>
<i>but to commence a
full-enforced resettlement</i>
<i>that fits krennic's schedule,</i>
we'll need a declaration of
martial domain as soon as possible.
Where is she?
She's unavailable at the moment.
I asked you "where?"
Captain kaido is arriving today.
- He's here.
- He's outside my office. Who is he?
He is a crisis specialist.
He'll be bringing a variety of
personnel to help manage the situation.
We have plenty of security.
What I need now is
some clarity on how exactly
dedra. Calmly.
Let the image of professional
ascendance settle your nerves.
<i>A successful conclusion to this problem</i>
will reinforce the isb's
position at the emperor's side.
You've done excellent
work bringing this forward.
Everyone that matters knows
how well you've played this.
<i>Captain kaido knows the objective.
He will answer to you operationally.</i>
<i>The tactical details, however,
will be at his discretion.</i>
You're aware, sir, that the
insurgents have weapons at this point.
We're counting on it.
Bombing at the naval depot?
I can't even get in there.
It's being investigated.
The rumor is it's a set-up.
They're running it down.
Who? And who's this tactical
guy in your control room?
There's evidence of outside agitators.
You serious?
That's what I came here for.
That is what I've been
trying to do since I got here.
That is what you told me
you wanted, and now...
Now there's evidence I have to beg for?
We are trying to prevent an incident.
By keeping me in the dark.
My sources say this is nonsense.
- Stop.
- What am I doing here?
Syril, please.
You need to go home and pack
and be ready to leave when I tell you.
What?
Good things are waiting for us.
We'll be out of here soon.
We'll be back in
Coruscant. We'll be together.
We'll be rewarded.
For what? What have we accomplished?
Be careful.
Me?
Do what I told you.
Thank you, kloris.
Are you planning to
go to the office today?
Eventually. It's lovely
out. I'm sure we'll walk.
It's just, they're asking
for schedules this week.
Parking and movement.
Who's asking?
Senate security.
Ridiculous.
I'll speak to them. Thank you.
I'm requesting a new driver.
Don't. They might send someone smart.
We lead from ghorman
again this morning
<i>with reports of another
terrorist attack overnight</i>
<i>as a series of explosions
rocked the naval terminal in palmo.</i>
Perhaps as many as three,
<i>rising over the imperial
naval terminal, where...</i>
With ghorman already under
curfew and increased security,
<i>this represents a turning
point in the terror campaign</i>
<i>that's been escalating for the past year.</i>
Freezing ghorman assets galaxy-wide
<i>and calling for an immediate and
complete blockade of material assistance</i>
<i>until the incident can be fully explained</i>
<i>and the terrorists have
been brought to justice.</i>
Senator mothma.
Apologies. I've been awaiting your arrival.
A word, if you please.
- I'll see you upstairs.
- Okay.
Senator oran.
Any news?
Only bad news for the ghormans.
I'm afraid we're near
the point of no return.
How can I help?
Turn back the clock.
Send everyone home.
How I wish I could make that so.
This bombing last night...
They have no shame, do they?
They don't even bother
to lie badly anymore.
I suppose that's the final humiliation.
We're assembling a petition, and
I know how... sad that must sound.
It takes more than failed
legislation to upset me these days.
I came here to thank you, mon.
Your constant courage.
The brave face you put to the world.
I've done a poor job letting you
know how much I admire your grace...
And energy.
Protect yourself.
Seriously?
What?
You could've just asked me.
You would've said no.
- Then what are we doing here?
- What's the harm?
You're lucky maarva is not here.
I'm not the one she'd
be straightening out.
- She hated force healers.
- She hated one force healer,
- 10 years ago.
- One was enough.
Doesn't mean the whole thing's a scam.
They wouldn't be faking
something if it never worked.
Why not? What does that even mean?
You know what I don't understand?
If I was in pain, I'd try to
do everything I could to fix it.
You just run around
pretending like nothing's wrong
and everyone knows it's not true.
What's the risk?
What is this?
- I don't know.
- You set this up.
No. No.
Who are you?
Nobody.
I was just walking
home. We're just leaving.
Can you wait? Please.
Give us a moment. I'll be back.
Sorry.
For what?
I was about to ask how I know you, but.
I'm realizing now that's not it at all.
I'm late already.
I'll see you back there.
He's got a blaster burn that's not healing.
Your right shoulder.
Tell her.
Yes.
May I?
Thank you.
"Thank you" for what?
The clarity.
That feeling.
It's been a very long time.
I thought it had gone for good.
It's so easy to lose faith.
They come, no matter what.
Sometimes it even works. But this...
You...
All that you've been gathering.
The strength of spirit.
Surely you must feel it.
I'll work on that.
I'll come back and let you know.
You saw something.
Why do you keep pushing?
Why are you so upset?
I asked you not to do this.
Stay if you want.
You scared him.
I'm sorry.
It's not easy to do.
Who is he?
A pilot.
A soldier.
Tell me what you saw.
I sense the weight of
things, things I can't see.
Pain, fear...
Need.
Most beings carry the
things that shaped them.
They carry the past.
But some... very few...
Your pilot...
They're gathering as they
go. There's a purpose to it.
He's a messenger.
There's some place he needs to be.
Have you known him long?
I don't remember not knowing him.
Maybe you're the place he needs to be.
Enza.
- Don't you know there's a curfew?
- I needed to see you.
Then have a good look.
I... think there's a way out of
this before things go too far.
My people are convinced you're
being coordinated by outside agitators.
If I had something to offer,
if we could lay this
off on outsiders, then...
It's better, isn't it?
That must be confusing.
She asked me who you
were. I said you were a pilot.
Don't tell people what I do.
What happened when she touched you?
She's a cook in the mess hall.
And you're more than a pilot.
It's ridiculous.
She knew you were there.
She felt it from across the
yard. She wasn't making that up.
That wasn't a scam.
- What was it, then?
- I don't know.
I don't even think she knows.
But it happened, and I could sense it,
and I'm not afraid to say that.
I've felt it before, cass.
She called you a messenger.
I've had dreams like that.
Why are you doing this?
What if it's important?
I know you felt something.
That's why you're so upset.
Let it in.
It can only be good.
There's no other reason.
What's all this?
We filed an exit plan.
Without a destination.
It's a personal trip.
This ship's to be fitted with
hyper-comms tomorrow.
We'll be back soon.
That is unacceptable, and you know it.
- This isn't a base for privateers.
- All set. Clear.
Those who enjoy the security of
yavin must proclaim their loyalties.
Don't push too hard.
You know where I stand.
The day I need permission
to come and go, I'm gone.
That day is near.
Fall out! Quick time!
Tighten up! Look lively!
Yes, sir.
Fall in!
Form up!
- Sergeant.
- Sir.
Get these men shaped up
and ready for presentation.
There's not a man amongst
them, sir, but I'll do what I can.
Am I gonna have a problem with you?
Duly noted, sir. Problem-free.
What is that supposed to be?
All right, listen in!
He's got a number of
units coming in today.
Attention!
Left turn!
They look like children.
Quick march!
Talk to me.
Twelve hundred at the Mark.
What are you doing?
- What?
- Look where you're going.
You said come in low, right?
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Hello.
And you.
Haven't seen you in a while.
I know.
Everyone's so busy.
Anything you can talk about?
Well, I'm here now. I'll be around.
I'm doin' intakes.
Scaring the new recruits.
No more smuggling?
I needed a break.
It's good to hear you say that.
I was getting reckless.
You're looking for cassian, aren't you?
No.
They sent me to talk to you.
Draven. Dodonna.
They need him, bix.
They're on the verge of promoting him,
and then he goes and does
something like this morning.
I know you.
I know how deeply you
believe in what we're doing.
We're not luthen's puppets anymore.
We're not a bunch of maniacs
running around aldhani.
We're building a real army.
Cassian is a leader now.
We've all given so much.
A little discipline doesn't
seem too much to ask.
He'll be there when you need him.
I'll pass that along.
When did this happen?
It's been a few months.
I've gotta get going.
What if the comms don't work?
We'll test first thing.
If that's a fail, we'll meet here.
Our secondary would be the ship.
Second floor, third from the left.
She's in there.
She sleeps in the building.
The locals say she's on the
Plaza once or twice a day.
She's easy to spot.
She doesn't stay any place very long.
The glass? It might need two shots.
I don't know.
It's old, but I can ask.
All right, here comes my guy.
Comms, first thing.
Ferrix.
Stone and sky.
Welcome.
Thank you.
Here.
You'll have to scan for them.
Ronni goo...
Goo-jah.
- Goo-jah.
- Mid-rim news.
Never heard of it.
We're trying to change that.
I don't see an entry stamp.
Journalists require imperial approval.
I... I know. Yeah. I just got in. I
I didn't wanna risk the... the curfew.
You'll have to go over there
tomorrow and sort it out.
- Yeah.
- We're required to notify them.
Of course. Yeah.
The Alderaan group. Their
shuttle's been canceled.
Again?
Good luck with that.
I have a room at the
front, facing the Plaza.
Perfect.
You know, most guests don't
say that anymore. It can be loud.
I'm a deep sleeper.
She will report it.
We turn over our guest
list each afternoon.
Good to know.
And you'll have to carry
your own bag this time.
You know the way.
Thank you.
Is this the weather center?
Clear skies tonight.
<i>We'll be updating the
forecast at first light.</i>
I'll make sure to listen.
We're always here.

﻿1
There's a mineral underground. Doctor!
Deep substrate foliated kalkite.
Should we fail to find any alternatives,
we will have to control
ghorman with a hand firm enough
to silence any resistance,
and you've been selected to
help plan for that possibility.
You need a radical
insurgency you can count on.
You need ghorman rebels you
can depend on to do the wrong thing.
Ghorman is a single-product economy.
We import almost
everything we need to survive.
I am constantly begging
my people to stay calm
<i>and do nothing that
might make things worse.</i>
The plan... your plan to bait
ghorman as a prize for outside agitators
needs to begin somewhere.
Luthen wants to know
if you're ready to work.
What does he need me for?
Isb supervisor, dedra meero.
She's there in ghorman.
She's there waiting to be killed.
We're drowning in rumors, syril.
<i>Many people are starting to think this
new building is more than just an annex.</i>
<i>I'm not sure why the empire would
build an armory in the middle of palmo,</i>
but I'm running out of answers.
There is, apparently,
no suitable replacement
or synthetic alternative for
the ghorman substrate material.
<i>I don't know the science,
but it's bad luck ghorman.</i>
She's in there.
She sleeps in the building.
<i>I've seen her on the terrace.</i>
I have a room at the
front, facing the Plaza.
Perfect.
You know, most guests don't
say that anymore. It can be loud.
I'm a deep sleeper.
You walk a very narrow path, dedra.
Syril must never know
what this is all really about.
Good things are waiting for us.
We'll be out of here soon.
We'll be back in
Coruscant. We'll be together.
We'll be rewarded.
For what? What have we accomplished?
Captain kaido is arriving today.
<i>He'll be bringing a variety of
personnel to help manage the situation.</i>
You're aware, sir, that the
insurgents have weapons at this point.
We're counting on it.
Let's go!
I want it done quickly. Double time!
Get that one ready next!
Help him, then.
One on each side.
Come on, soldier, look lively!
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
Come on, you! Look lively!
Get that one ready next!
Move with purpose. Let's go!
Cassian.
What is all this?
<i>Did you know about this?</i>
Know about what?
<i>They're pulling it all in.</i>
Pulling what from where?
The barricades. What's going on here?
- They're opening the Plaza.
- You hear that?
- I'm looking at it.
- They're not opening anything.
They're putting a shell
around the building.
- What do you mean?
- I won't get a shot from here.
They're building a fortress.
- Apologies.
- I know you've been waiting.
There's reports coming
in from the countryside.
They're saying we've landed mining rigs.
You seem animated.
Rumors spread quickly these days.
Well, I'm sure captain kaido
has his assets in position.
<i>That's why I thought it urgent we speak.</i>
He's given orders to
barricade the building.
<i>I saw that. Seems a wise idea.</i>
The mining equipment. Already on site.
Is that a story director
krennic wants to be telling?
<i>We're done with local rumors.</i>
<i>The only story that matters
is ghorman aggression.</i>
The threats. The inexplicable
resistance to imperial norms.
<i>We need what's in the ground.</i>
<i>The empire has been
patient long enough.</i>
Our struggles with ghorman
are well documented at this point.
Samm.
The continued and inexplicable
ghorman resistance to imperial norms.
Many people, even some
ghormans, have already been asking
how long the empire's
Patience can be tested.
And here we are this morning
with rumors of a general
strike and mass demonstrations
how the imperial authorities
can calm the situation down.
<i>The casualties from yesterday's
bombing of the naval depot</i>
<i>are still yet to be finalized.</i>
<i>The fear is the numbers will be
minimized to lower the temperature here.</i>
<i>If that is the case, it certainly
doesn't seem to be working.</i>
<i>There were mass
curfew violations last night</i>
<i>and rumors of a general
strike this morning.</i>
Sorry, sir. Comms are
down. We're making rounds.
Imperial employees are to report
immediately to the ioc building.
Nache-band or!
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!
We are the ghor!
You! Karn!
You dare walk our streets?
You dare walk among us?
All this time, you...
How could we be so foolish?
I meant you no harm.
How do you say that?
How do you speak the words?
You've destroyed us.
I was here to trap outside agitators.
Look at you. Even now...
People know what you're doing.
We've had reports all night.
There's mining equipment
being dropped all over the planet.
- Rigs and droids and...
- that's a rumor!
Are you mad?
That I'd believe that?
That it's worth saying?
What kind of a being are you?
What's in our ground?
What is it you've been
sent to steal from us?
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!
Everything as you wanted?
What I want is a comfortable ride home.
But let's not confuse
the chain of command.
I'm the trigger, supervisor.
You're the finger.
Make sure you're available.
I'm not sure I'll be back.
Not to worry. You were never here.
Didn't log you in.
Hey, I hope things work out for you.
Rebellions are built on hope.
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!
Help him. Radio.
Don't make me look for you again.
No, sir.
Get the south steps unit on the line.
The galaxy is watching!
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!
A peaceful demonstration,
local insurgents
the galaxy is watching!
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!
Enza!
The galaxy is watching!
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!
Can you hear me?
- Cassian!
- Where are you?
Wil?
Can you hear me?
Where are you?
Repeat. Where are you? Talk to me.
- No way through.
- I work here.
- Hey! Hey! Over here!
- Let him in.
He knows me.
Even though imperial officials strive
to desperately negotiate
a peaceful demonstration,
the local insurgents spread
rumors through the night
and have organized this...
This highly volatile insurrection
you see behind me now.
Sir, we need to go.
I need to get upstairs.
Just be a minute, sir.
Just making sure we're all safe.
Over here.
Just be a minute until things calm down.
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!
Close all the exits.
Yes, sir.
Channel five is open?
Standing by, sir.
South gate, unit one, come in.
It'll be all right. Stay with cap so.
I have to go find my friend.
Patrol, sir? Within the crowd?
Was that not my order?
They're green, sir. They're useless.
I see imperial uniforms, sergeant.
I see a barricade Lane to the
memorial that I need kept open.
You will march them out there
immediately and secure the area.
Or you can all finish your
days in an imperial brig.
Stand to!
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!
Wait! Hang on, I said wait!
What have you done?
Get out.
Close it.
What are we doing here?
Following orders.
How long have you known about all this?
How long?
We can discuss this later.
It is too late already.
Syril, please.
You're gonna tell me what
this has really been about.
- You're hurting me.
- And you are going to tell me
what the mining ships are doing here.
- They're not...
- there is an armada up there!
They're already unloading
in jel-novi and leequa.
- You couldn't even wait.
- No
don't.
You tell me it's a rumor and I
will throw you out that window.
What have we been doing here?
There's a stone.
Something in the dirt here.
They need it. It's the energy program.
It's directly from the emperor.
It's something they can't do
without. They need the planet.
How long have you known this?
We're going home, syril.
We're going home as heroes.
This began long before we got here.
They've been planning it for years.
They're doing this no matter what.
We wanted to be together.
You didn't seem to mind the promotions.
Good luck, dedra.
Move out.
Eyes open. Keep it moving.
Sir.
Sir!
Find syril. Bring him back. Do
not let him leave the building.
Partagaz is on the line.
Move out!
Close! Close!
- Wilmon.
- Tell me where you are.
West Side. The
columns by the cafhouse.
- Find me.
- I can't hear you.
Find me.
Hold the line!
Orders, please.
Supervisor meero.
Proceed.
Put him on.
Channel five? Open.
One transmit five. One calling five.
Five online. Standing by.
Fire at will. Repeat. Fire at will.
Get back! Get back!
Withdraw! Withdraw!
Withdraw!
Man down! Get him out of here!
Open fire!
Behind you!
Retreat and fire!
Keep the formation!
Incoming!
Bottle!
Get down!
Balor!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Get back! Get back!
Run!
He's out there.
Supervisor, it's not safe.
Put them out there.
Get back! Come on!
Run!
Help! Help!
Who are you?
Cassian!
Come on, let's go.
Come on. Yeah.
You okay?
I'm okay. I'm okay.
We need to move.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Capso! Hey!
Where's dreena?
She ran. She was with
us. We never had a chance.
Where is she?
They went for the radio.
She might have been with them.
I have to find my brother!
Hey, hey! What are you doing?
- I'm not leaving without dreena.
- No, no, no, no, no!
- I've gotta find her!
- Wilmon, stop!
- We have to leave.
- It's not far.
Hey. Everything is far.
We need a ride to the ship.
Look at me!
Run!
Don't stop!
Get up, get up! Get up!
Cassian!
Is it dead?
You killed it.
Hey, I know you.
- Samm.
- I remember you.
Thank you.
I have to get to the hq.
That's where I'm going.
- Okay.
- No, we're leaving!
I told you I can't.
You go. I'll be all right. You'll see.
Wil, please.
I can't leave her behind.
Tell people what happened here, cass.
Ferrix.
Stone and sky.
Wait!
One last favor.
Palmo one.
<i>This is palmo one. This
is the voice of ghorman.</i>
<i>This is palmo one making
an emergency broadcast</i>
<i>on all open channels.</i>
<i>This is palmo one! This is palmo one.</i>
<i>We are under siege.
We're being slaughtered.</i>
<i>The imperial murder
of ghorman has begun.</i>
<i>There are hundreds
of bodies this moment.</i>
<i>As I say these words,</i>
<i>hundreds of murdered
ghormans lay dead in palmo Plaza.</i>
<i>Thousands more on the
streets. More every minute.</i>
<i>We're being destroyed!</i>
<i>This is ghorman reaching for
any open channel that can hear me!</i>
<i>If you can... if you can hear me...</i>
<i>If you believe in truth, if
you have any faith left in truth,</i>
<i>please, please Mark this
message and pass it forward.</i>
<i>This is murder!</i>
<i>The empire built this fire.</i>
<i>They made this fire and
led us to the slaughter.</i>
<i>Now they expect us to
die without knowing why.</i>
<i>The conspiracy we've feared is real!</i>
<i>It's here today!</i>
<i>Imperial ships are already landing across</i>
no!
Help us!
Is there no one who can help us?
Is there no one?
Dreena!
I found you.
We gotta let people know
what happened. Help me.
<i>Even as imperial security forces
are still assessing casualties,</i>
<i>even as our fallen heroes are
beginning their final journeys home,</i>
<i>questions are being asked about
how an insurrection of this scale</i>
<i>could be mounted
without the aid and support</i>
<i>of outside rebel assistance.</i>
<i>In the days to come,</i>
<i>as the imperial martyrs
of ghorman are mourned,</i>
<i>we're sure to learn a great deal
more about what happened here today</i>
<i>and the price we'll
pay for our own safety.</i>

﻿1
If it's a war, and you keep saying it is,
it's not up to us what
we save, what we lose...
But if I'm giving up
everything, I want to win.
I thought you were a local boy.
My father's chandrilan.
I was born in Naboo.
My mother's ghorman.
Bounced around until she passed
away, and then mon stepped in.
Ghorman needs this
legislation more than anyone.
I am constantly begging
my people to stay calm
<i>and do nothing that
might make things worse.</i>
They're finally wanting to do something
<i>and you tell them to be careful.</i>
<i>You're thinking small.
You're thinking like a thief.</i>
I'm thinking like a soldier.
Think like a leader.
Tell me what you saw.
I sense the weight of
things, things I can't see.
He's a messenger.
I'm meeting with tay next week.
I'll warn him off. I'll find what it takes.
- I'll get a number.
- You know the number.
We'd be vulnerable forever.
You need to be protected.
I'm not sure what you're saying.
How nice for you.
Luthen wants to know
if you're ready to work.
What does he need me for?
Isb supervisor, dedra meero.
<i>She's there in ghorman,
waiting to be killed.</i>
- What's all this?
- It's a personal trip.
That is unacceptable, and you know it.
All set.
They're on the verge of promoting him,
and then he goes and does
something like this morning.
He'll be there when you need him.
Think about a planet
like ghorman in rebellion.
<i>A planet of wealth and status.</i>
And if it goes up in flames?
It will burn... very brightly.
Open fire!
This is palmo one.
<i>We are under siege.
We're being slaughtered.</i>
<i>The imperial murder
of ghorman has begun.</i>
<i>As I say these words,</i>
<i>hundreds of murdered
ghorman lay dead in palmo Plaza.</i>
<i>Thousands more on the streets.</i>
More every minute.
<i>We're being destroyed!</i>
Who are you?
- If you can...
- If you can hear me...
<i>If you believe in truth, if
you have any faith left in truth,</i>
<i>please, please Mark this
message and pass it forward.</i>
Help us!
<i>Is there no one who can help us?</i>
Is there no one?
I am a senator! With the
full rights and protections...
What's going on?
- Ambassador oran...
- He's being arrested.
- Stand back and get your arms off!
- What?
- Stormtroopers!
- In the senate!
No warrant! No charges!
This is the senate chamber,
I have every right to be here.
Will no one help me?
Ghorman is being slaughtered!
It's my people today and yours tomorrow!
Remember this day!
Remember ghorman!
This will be you soon enough.
Remember this day!
Have you seen the
numbers? The ghorman dead?
It's beyond belief.
Don't put on the imperial news.
- I've seen it. It's insane.
- The winner writes the story.
Well, they haven't won yet.
I need to make a speech tomorrow.
They'll never let you take the floor.
Well, I've seen you work miracles before.
Has to be done, bail.
I can't take it anymore.
And yes, I know there's no
telling what the emperor's...
Capable of at this...
At this point, anything is possible.
But they've gone too
far and we all know it.
We need to speak out. We need
to stand up, and speak the truth,
and then we need to leave. Both of us.
We need an exit plan, and we need to
make it now while we still have the time.
We have a plan. That's not the issue.
Then what is it?
I'm not going anywhere.
- Are you telling me to be silent?
- It's not like that.
Senator.
We talked about this. What
might happen. If this isn't the limit,
- then what is?
- It's not so easy.
Compared to what? Nothing we will ever do
will be as hard as hiding all these years.
Mon.
It's not that... at all.
It's me.
I have to stay. We have to buy time.
We're not ready. Yavin isn't ready.
We need to stall.
But you're right,
something needs to be said.
And yavin needs your
leadership. I just can't go with you.
Not yet.
You'd be a hostage.
Let's hope not.
Work on the speech, and be very careful.
Senator ton found a
listening device in her office.
And tell no one.
Be ready to leave the
moment you're done.
And be very careful.
They're calling an early
session at the senate.
If she speaks, we need to be ready...
So we're keeping you a journalist.
It's perfect.
Ronnie googe, mid-rim network.
You're coming straight
from the ghorman massacre
to cover the political fallout.
There's a senate
catering entrance we like.
These credentials will work inside, but
they scan for weapons at the entrance.
You'll wanna hang on to this one.
It's a surface pass, it's good all season.
I won't be needing it.
I'm not coming back.
I'm done after this.
Are you?
What does that mean?
Done?
Done with what? With us? With all of it?
He'll know what it means.
So, it's a private thing,
something I wouldn't understand.
- I didn't say that.
- Can I guess?
You're tired. It's too much. It's too hard.
You were a witness to
the ghorman massacre,
one would think there'd
be no stopping you.
The senator you'll be saving
is about to risk everything
putting a voice to the
atrocity you just survived.
Tell her you're "done."
When have I not come through?
I need to start making my own decisions.
I thought that's what we were fighting for.
Clean yourself up.
I'll find you some clothes.
I need to keep looking.
We have to be sure.
I need to practice the speech.
Not here. Not yet.
Get some air. Go to the Plaza.
It's not on our end.
So it just went dead?
The death of truth is
the ultimate victory of evil.
When truth leaves us...
When it is ripped from our hands,
vulnerable to the appetite of
whatever monster screams the loudest...
How did you know I would be here?
Erskin Semaj works for me.
He wanted to tell you
himself, but here we are.
All this time?
He's protected you in
ways you'll never know.
Well, isn't that wonderfully cryptic?
Who else am I trusting that I shouldn't?
Everyone?
Well, let me guess. In the end,
it's only you I can trust. Is that it?
Tonight, that's true.
Is it?
Bail organa's team is corrupted.
Which team is that?
The one that's taking you
to yavin after your speech.
I don't know everything, mon,
but I know what I owe you.
You don't care about me.
You're just terrified what'll
happen if I get arrested.
You need to think clearly.
Be careful what you ask for.
You can't leave with bail's people.
And you can't tell anyone
what I've just told you.
Do you remember tay kolma?
The banker? My childhood friend?
Another false savior.
I often think of tay kolma.
How quickly you decided he was a
risk. How quickly all that happened.
If you go with bail's plan,
you'll be in a cell before sunset.
It makes me quite a risk, doesn't it?
Right now, I'm more
afraid of you than anything.
We've all been bent
by secrecy, haven't we?
And I'm sorry about erskin,
but what I'm telling
you about bail is true.
Don't you dare!
What I'm telling you cannot be shared.
I'm sending someone I trust,
someone I know I can trust.
You'll ask if he's alone.
He will say, "I have friends everywhere."
"I have friends everywhere."
Those words.
Supervisor grandi isn't
in yet. I'm still on call.
Is it something that can wait?
Senator mothma, we
have a field agent with her.
Yes, I know. Her driver.
He's been calling in.
Apparently, she's not
left the senate tonight.
Is that unusual?
He seems to think so.
We were told to pay particular attention
to the senate for the next few days,
given the situation in ghorman.
Do we have a console?
The technicians said
there's no malfunction
or communication issues on our end.
Right here, these are all senators
the select council have approved
for increased surveillance.
It's always a bit quiet this early,
but... that's senator mothma.
It's gone dead.
Plus the driver, it
seemed worth mentioning.
We free to speak?
I've searched everything.
I'm not sure I've felt
this... Betrayed in my life,
and I've... Had some experience.
When... did you start?
After the wedding.
Two years.
That's obscene.
I've tried to protect you.
And you've failed.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
You're dismissed.
Immediately.
It's been an honor.
I wasn't sure you'd come.
Wilmon?
There was someone he needed to find.
Excuse me. We have
an immediate problem.
Did you talk to mothma?
What are we doing?
I shouldn't have told her about erskin.
Is she speaking or not?
I don't know.
Somebody knows.
- Where are you?
- I'm walking to the senate.
I'm out. She threw me out.
Is she going through with it?
Ask luthen. We didn't have
much of a conversation.
We get her out, she
goes to yavin and not you?
No yavin for me.
There's still some
Bridges you haven't burned.
We'll take care of that today.
You've stayed here long enough.
I'm not finished yet.
They're gonna find you, luthen!
You act as if we had a choice.
Eventually, they'll hang
us both, won't they?
We set that course the first time we met.
Speak for yourself.
You see no truth in that?
I make my own decisions.
Is that what you've been doing?
Sometimes, I wonder.
You appeared when I needed you.
Aldhani.
Narkina. Ferrix.
Sienar. Mina-rau. Ghorman.
And here we are.
She threw him out.
We don't know if she's speaking,
what she'll say, or how they'll react.
All we know about bail organa's
team is that there's something wrong.
It's hardly ideal.
There's no choice but to try.
We have nothing. He's
never even been inside.
Erskin knows the building.
Putting a lot of faith in erskin.
Mothma knows the building.
And doesn't trust me.
And doesn't know him.
Bail's people might be there already.
And? If she gets arrested?
It all comes down.
Hello?
Identify yourself.
Kloris, sir. Exmar kloris.
Have you located senator mothma?
- No, sir.
- She's been in there all night.
Or she's gone home without you.
Without letting me know?
That's not like her. I doubt it.
She was upset, sir. The
news out of ghorman.
Let us know if anything changes.
Will do. Yes, sir.
Scan docs, please.
Proceed.
Yes, madam. Thank you.
Proceed.
- Ronnie goo...
- "Goo-ja."
Did someone call it in?
Mid-rim network.
I see that. I just don't have
a bay assigned for you.
You'll have to float this morning.
That's the best I can do today.
- You've met?
- Just now.
What are we doing?
Senator mothma's making a speech.
When she's done, we'll
escort her to the Plaza
where there's a ride waiting.
Weapons?
We have a box inside, but the plan
is for a quick and quiet extraction.
Gate 9. She'll meet us there.
We'll pull the gear
and meet you up there.
<i>To make a difference here...
I represent the people...</i>
Well, I'm stuck here now, so
let me know if anything changes.
There are rumors that
prominent senators may try
to challenge the imperial
narrative on ghorman.
I've just been told the
morning agenda is set.
The chair has no intention of
letting any of them take the floor.
Here we are. This day has finally come.
You don't have to do this.
If you're brave enough to stay,
I should be brave enough to go.
There'll be an escort team
waiting. A team of three.
You need to leave the
moment you're done.
They'll be at gate 9.
Get down there. Do what they tell you.
- Do you trust them?
- Of course.
Do you know them?
Personally? No. I can't.
It's not safe.
Don't worry about me.
Once I get you started,
I'll have my head down.
Next year. In yavin.
Take care of yourself, bail.
We do what we can.
Tear the shit out of this place.
<i>The senate is called to chamber.</i>
<i>Make your presence known.</i>
<i>Stewards, you may count the quorum.</i>
You'd think it'd be full today.
They call an early session when
they want to keep the numbers down.
<i>The stewards have declared a quorum...</i>
Have we met?
It's possible.
I have friends everywhere.
Immediately following this session,
we shall submit a list of
our fallen, imperial patriots,
martyrs who gave everything
on the brutal streets of ghorman.
<i>A list that, even now, grows longer</i>
<i>as the full measure of ghorman
perfidy comes into focus.</i>
There's a rope line at the gate.
Take this. It's the only way in,
and I'm the last person she wants to see.
Were we not warned?
<i>Were there not voices raising
the alarm about ghorman long ago?</i>
<i>As the threat grew,</i>
<i>did we not Mark the arrival of
every new ghorman provocation?</i>
<i>The tragic broth we sip this morning
has been brewing in plain sight!</i>
<i>The only surprise about
yesterday's insurgency</i>
<i>was the savagery of the ghorman attack!</i>
We, too, lost a citizen
yesterday on the ghorman Plaza.
We, too, are grieving and wondering
what more we might've
done to stop this insurrection.
Watch the door. I'll get the blasters.
And to those who fail to see
this as an emergency, I say,
<i>"what will you tell your people"</i>
"when it is one of your citizens
who've been slaughtered?"
Sir... one of supervisor jung's
agents is calling from the senate.
She says it's urgent.
Line 2.
Hello?
Hello.
Identify yourself.
What're you doing?
Who're you talking to?
It was work.
- Show me that.
- Sure.
Hello?
The chair recognizes the
senior senator from hodi.
<i>Graciously accepted, thank you.</i>
<i>I would, as senior senator,
like to yield a moment of my time</i>
to the senior senator of Alderaan
who has a point of order to address.
Thank you, senator erveen.
I need instructions.
I'm putting on the supervisor in charge.
She... she's back on, sir!
I know there's a strict
agenda this morning,
but as per the latest imperial
ruling on senate protocols,
a-17-252, was, as you may recall,
proposed directly by
the emperor's council...
And specifically states that,
"a senior senator, in
the case of emergency"
<i>"may yield the floor freely,"</i>
<i>"without interruption to
another senior senator."</i>
<i>Now, senator karloo
spoke so passionately</i>
<i>about the imperial martyrs from
yesterday's events in ghorman.</i>
<i>I listened very
carefully, as did you all...</i>
And he clearly, and repeatedly,
used the word "emergency,"
<i>and as there's been no objection
to this description from the floor,</i>
I am invoking article 17-252
and yielding the floor to the
senior senator from chandrila.
Shut down the senate feed.
Imperial authority.
Shut it down.
Yes.
Fellow senators, friends, colleagues...
Allies, adversaries.
I stand before you this
morning with a heavy heart.
The chandrilan emblem on the door.
I've spent my life in this chamber.
<i>I came here as a child.</i>
- Hey.
- Thank you.
And as I look around me now,
<i>I realize I have almost no
memories that pre-date my arrival...</i>
<i>And few bonds of affection
that cleave so tightly.</i>
<i>Through these many years,</i>
<i>I believe I have served
my constituents honorably</i>
<i>and upheld our code of conduct.</i>
- Where were you?
- Where's charval?
He was with you.
- This chamber...
- He said to meet you.
Is a cauldron of opinions...
And we've certainly all had
our Patience and tempers tested
in pursuit of our ideals.
Disagree as we might.
<i>I am hopeful that those of you who
know me will vouch for my credibility</i>
<i>in the days to come.</i>
<i>I stand this morning
with a difficult message.</i>
I believe we are in crisis.
What are they doing?
The distance between
what is said... Shut it down!
And what is known to be
true has become an abyss.
It's locked. Why is it locked?
It's supposed to be.
It hasn't been locked all year.
- We know. We fixed it.
- What?
- We checked the protocol...
- open it!
- You need the sequence key.
- So let's have it!
We took it up to the
security office yesterday.
Of all the things at risk
the loss of an objective reality
is perhaps the most dangerous.
<i>The death of truth is
the ultimate victory of evil.</i>
When truth leaves us,
when we let it slip away,
when it is ripped from our hands,
<i>we become vulnerable to the appetite
of whatever monster screams the loudest.</i>
I don't care if you have to cut
power to the whole chamber!
Get her off the air!
This chamber's hold on the truth
was finally lost on the ghorman Plaza.
What took place yesterday...
What happened yesterday on ghorman
was unprovoked genocide!
Yes! Genocide!
And that truth has been
exiled from this chamber!
And the monster screaming the loudest?
The monster we've helped create?
The monster who will come
for all of us soon enough...
Is emperor palpatine!
They shut her down. They
shut down the broadcast.
Where's cassian?
He went up.
Look, we can't wait here much longer.
Senator.
I can't speak right now.
I was in ghorman yesterday.
I saw everything. In the Plaza.
I've made my statement.
No. We need to speak.
I have friends everywhere.
Detained immediately. She
does not leave the building!
Your cousin vel is a friend.
Anyone could say that.
We're the last survivors
of the raid on aldhani.
I see her in yavin.
I live there.
I know luthen can be hard...
But if he's right about this...
You have no choice but to come with me.
You just keep walking.
I'll be right behind you.
Senator mothma!
The senator has no
comment at the moment!
Let her through! Let her through!
Can we get a comment, please?
Move, please! Please!
Excuse us! The senator has a
very important meeting to get to.
- Who are you?
- We're here to help you.
- She doesn't need your help.
- Let's move ahead.
- Stand down, everyone!
- She's got a gun!
- What're you doing?
- Shut up! Back off!
This is an isb authorized arrest!
Call your supervisor now!
Back away! That means you!
- She's a rebel spy!
- No!
Anyone else?
- Who are you?
- Nobody.
We just met, I swear!
- We have no time to figure this out.
- I know.
Go, I'll get there.
We need three minutes.
- I... I'm not isb...
- shut up!
Down!
Are you sure?
I've got this, go!
Okay.
Don't run. Don't run!
You killed that woman!
Put this on.
We need to get to the rear loading
dock. There's a ride waiting for us.
I'm not sure I can do this.
Welcome to the rebellion.
- What?
- The loading dock.
She's gone.
They're shutting down the building.
Forget the loading dock.
He's asking to evacuate the building.
No! Seal it up! Lock it down!
Where's jung's agent?
We're still trying!
They're at gate 9.
They've killed jung's agent.
- You were told to stand by!
- Right, I am standing by. I was just
<i>- call when you have something to report!
- Yes. Of course. I was just making...</i>
Where are they?
You have to get back to the gallery.
They're coming down
here. You have to warn them.
I'll find them!
Look, I'm trying, but
we've got to be ready.
Go to the gallery.
Secure the area! Cover all the exits!
We're in lockdown! No
one goes out! Move it out!
What's going on up there?
I wish I knew.
That's my driver.
- Would he help?
- No, no, no, he's an isb plant!
- What's his name?
- What?
- Name!
- Kloris.
Kloris! Kloris!
- What are you doing?
- We found her!
And who are you?
Hey. Look at me!
Hey, hey, hey, look at me.
Give me your hand.
Colonel yularen on line 3.
All right, everything on the table.
Fall in! Let's go!
Quit your moving about!
Last call on ordnance,
if you've got a weapon
and it's not on that table,
it means you're either
too stupid to follow orders
or you're a threat to base security.
Once the duty officer
has made inspection,
everything that meets
approval will be returned.
Who belongs to this?
I think that's mine.
Are you all right?
I can't believe you made it.
You must be exhausted.
Is he back there?
Made it out. Dreena saved the day.
He needs a real doctor.
Kleya.
Luthen.
He's safe.
He knows you made it back here.
Almost home.
You need to leave right away.
She may need a few
minutes to catch her breath.
She's not going with you.
There's a ship waiting. They
want her to make a speech.
They want her coming
in with a yavin escort.
They wanna rewrite the story.
What does luthen want?
He wants wilmon with a doctor.
Get him ready.
You know this place.
Yeah.
I lived here once.
I'm not sure...
How to thank you.
Make it worth it.
- Let's lift him by the arms.
- Careful.
- Let's go.
- One. Two.
Be careful.
Hey, go with them.
They'll fix him up.
Get some rest. Go.
Is it bad?
No.
It's clean. He's young.
Who's his nurse?
She survived the ghorman massacre.
She'll fit right in.
We are not gonna log this
in. Any of this. That's the plan.
Gold squadron will
deliver the senator to yavin.
She's making a speech, we
need it broadcast as far as possible.
It's the result that matters.
We can listen in my office if you like.
I've heard her before.
There's a dead kx unit bagged up inside.
Kx droid?
I think we got all the pieces.
What is it?
Nerian leaf.
You need to sleep.
Is that what I need?
I'm done, bix.
- Have your tea.
- I'm serious.
I'm done. I'm not doing it anymore.
I've done what I can.
And I've done a lot, but...
But I want... this.
Right here.
I wanna be with you.
I'm gonna talk to Draven tomorrow.
We'll leave before it
gets too complicated.
We'll find someplace quiet.
There's still places to go to.
We have what we need.
Why aren't you saying anything?
I'm listening.
The only special thing about me is luck...
And I've overplayed my hand already.
Nothing's worth more than this.
- I mean it.
- I know.
I know you do.
Bix?
My love. You're sleeping now.
You look so peaceful.
I wanna be brave, but I can't.
If I was brave, I would
stay and do this in person...
But I know you and
you'd just talk me around,
and I've been thinking about
this too long to let that happen.
I have to leave.
I have to go away.
<i>I'm not sure where or for how long,</i>
<i>I just know that I can't
stay here with you now.</i>
<i>I believe what you said.</i>
It is a choice.
It just can't be me.
<i>I can't be the reason you leave here.</i>
<i>If you ever gave this up for me, I'd.</i>
<i>I'd never forgive myself.</i>
We have to win.
We have to beat them.
<i>And I believe you have purpose in
making that happen. I need to believe that.</i>
So, I'm choosing for the both of us.
I'm choosing the rebellion.
Hey! You can't stand there!
We're waiting on a freighter,
we gotta keep this clear.
The outbound. The
transport, where are they?
Everything that's
leaving went this morning.
- And when it's done...
- When it's over...
And we've won...
We can do all the things we ever wanted.
Everything we'd know we've missed.
I'll find you.
- Captain and or?
- They were looking for you.
They're getting ready to power
up the droid you brought in.
The kx unit?
So...
It either works or... it doesn't.
We can tweak endlessly once it's stable.
It's really just a question of whether
the cortex-swap is rejected or not.
You'll hear a lot of blather
about "re-programming,"
which makes it sound as though it's a
problem solved behind a console, but...
That's nonsense, frankly.
It's really all about
"impulse suppression,"
which is an entirely...
Engineering and wiring issue.
Right. We have some
protective goggles here.
I'll take a weapon.
You may wish to take a step back.
Turn it on.
It's just... I'm not sure that's safe.
Hit the switch.
Very well.
If that makes us ready.
Three.
Two.
One.
Hello.
If I've offended you, I apologize.
If not, I'd appreciate you
pointing that elsewhere.

Wouldn't you rather give it all at once
to something real?
What would we be stealing?
The quarterly payroll
for an entire Imperial sector.
That's why you're here? Revenge?
Yeah, that's good enough for now.
I didn't mark you for a team player.
Working with other people is never easy.
<i>We're taking crates of payroll
from that vault,</i>
<i>loading the freighter,
and escaping out of the runway tunnel.</i>
Escaping? In a Rono?
You'll be lucky to make the horizon.
No one's stupid enough to try it.
No one but us.
It's about confidence.
We belong here.
We're followin' orders.
Wait!
Surprise from above
is never as shocking as one from below.
Don't move.
He comes here with nothin'
but the clothes on his back
and a stone worth 30,000 credits?
Who brings a treasure to a robbery?
I'm being paid.
You can't live with that?
I don't wanna walk in
looking over my shoulder.
<i>Looks just like your model.</i>
Should do.
I've had plenty of time to study,
and we've been
sneaking up here for months.
<i>There's nothing else
you can do, Luthen.</i>
They're either gonna be okay or not.
The thief. Andor.
I wasn't careful.
It'll all be over this time tomorrow.
Or it'll just be starting.
I couldn't sleep.
It's natural.
I need to be at my best.
Don't worry.
The excitement will kick in.
I'm struggling to understand
why my faith doesn't calm me.
I believe in something.
Why am I so unsettled?
I mean, you have nothing,
you sleep like a stone.
I write when I can't sleep.
Wrote about you last night.
Not you specifically, not "Clem."
Although I'm assuming
that's not your real name, anyway.
"The Role of Mercenaries
in The Galactic Struggle for Freedom."
My conclusion is simple.
Weapons are tools.
Those that use them are, by extension,
assets that we must use
to our best advantage.
The Empire has no moral boundaries,
why should we not take hold
of every chance we can?
Let them see how an insurgency adapts.
Well, you're half right.
The Empire doesn't play by the rules.
And how am I wrong?
They don't care enough to learn.
They don't have to.
You mean nothing to them.
Perhaps they'll think
differently tomorrow.
Be careful what you wish for.
So you think it's hopeless, do you?
Freedom? Independence? Justice?
We should just submit and be thankful?
Just take what we're given?
Do I look thankful to you?
No.
But I'm glad that you're here.
No matter what the reason.
Don't worry.
You'll be fine.
You'll sleep when it's done.
The Dhanis, they're a simple people.
They breed a sad combination of traits
that make them particularly vulnerable
to manipulation.
<i>On a practical level,</i>
<i>they have great difficulty holding
multiple ideas simultaneously.</i>
We've found the best way to steer them
as we'd like is to offer alternatives.
You put a number of options on the table,
and they're so wrapped up in choosing,
they fail to notice
you've given them nothing
they thought they wanted at the start.
<i>Their deeper problem is pride.</i>
<i>The Dhanis would rather lose,
they'd rather suffer, than accept.</i>
<i>Which is wildly ironic</i>
<i>as they've choked down
everything we've thrown at them</i>
<i>these last 12 years.</i>
<i>It's a ten-day trek up from the Lowlands.</i>
<i>We offered them a transport
because we know they'll refuse,</i>
but then, along the way,
we've placed a series of "Comfort Units,"
shelters and taverns
with cheap local beverages.
Quite predictably,
what began as 500 pilgrims at the bottom
has already dwindled down to...
- Where are we now, Lieutenant?
- We counted 60 last night, sir.
They may pick up
some highland stragglers along the way,
but it's developing as we'd expected.
Not that long ago,
they'd put 15,000 out there.
Have they any idea this is the last time
they'll be allowed up here?
No, there's no profit in that.
We've spent the last decade promoting
an Imperial viewing festival
down in the Enterprise Zone.
They'll have that going forward.
It is their sacred valley, is it not?
Well, ultimately, they will return,
won't they, Colonel?
When you need plenty of arms and legs
to build all you've got planned.
You've been here the longest,
haven't you, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir. Seven years.
Will the Dhanis let us build
our new facility in peace?
I don't see them having a choice.
The Eye, Colonel, you're in for a treat.
It really is something to see.
Quite the celestial spectacle.
I'm looking forward to it.
Now, what do you make of him?
Colonel Petigar?
He's an engineer. You won't charm him.
Well, it won't be for lack of trying.
Are we secure?
I've brought in 30 sentries from Alkenzi.
I'll be supervising them.
I've sent our best men to the perimeters.
- Tonight must be perfect.
- That's the plan, sir.
Perfect.
I want that word ringing in your ears.
<i>Echo-One.</i>
Echo-One.
Echo-One.
Echo-One on spot.
Echo-One.
- Go ten up.
- What is that?
Fieldcomm. It's a battle radio.
Looks Imperial.
Not anymore.
Echo-One.
- Echo-One.
- Go three up.
What? It's not working?
It will. It locks in.
When it does, it will carry on working
long after everything else is fried.
<i>Valley-One. Valley-One.</i>
<i>Valley-One, go. Valley-One.</i>
Valley-One. Valley-One on spot.
Valley-One. Valley-One.
<i>Echo engaged. Lockin' now.</i>
Lock and confirm, Echo. Lock and confirm.
Confirm. We're locked in.
<i>We're dialed in.</i>
<i>Movin' now.</i>
Safe travels.
<i>And to you.</i>
Valley-One out.
Let's pick it up.
Fallin' behind.
He likes giving orders, doesn't he?
Makes sense, right?
What do you mean?
They didn't tell you, did they?
He was a stormtrooper.
Really?
Pick it up!
You should've been here
when Cinta found out.
They slaughtered her whole family.
Pick it up.
Has it started?
Well, the Dhanis
don't believe it ever ends.
So, yes, sir, it has definitely started.
Gorn here. Go ahead.
<i>Low Road Unit reporting, sir.</i>
The guests are arriving.
<i>Let's have a peaceful welcome.</i>
Will do, sir.
Form up!
But do it quietly.
<i>Tighten up. Eyes front.</i>
<i>They'll be here any minute.</i>
<i>You're a soldier now, Clem.</i>
<i>These people hate us.</i>
<i>The ones that have climbed this far
have made a life of it.</i>
<i>Do not engage.</i>
We meet soldiers from the garrison?
We're from Alkenzi.
They're from Alkenzi?
We're from the garrison.
Keep your mouths shut,
and remember, we belong here.
It might be best
if we split these up between us, and...
Hysterical.
I said, "You can't both be right."
They're just gonna be
waiting for him, right?
I had a good look at her.
Believe me, patience was not
the first thing that came to mind.
Oi, here comes another one.
Whoo!
Oh, look at that.
Come on.
Let's get back to base.
Escort, march!
Roboda?
- Roboda.
- I'm dressing Leonart.
He's 12, he can dress himself.
Come and look at this sash.
None of this was stored properly.
It's all compressed.
Perhaps you've expanded.
Where's his Imperial blouse?
I'm not wearing that.
You'll do as you're told.
Mother, I don't feel well.
You'll make an effort tonight
if it kills you.
He might have a fever.
- He might feel the back of my hand.
- The boy is ill, Jayhold.
He's always ill.
Look, you wanna get out of here, do you?
Get that transfer,
leave this stinking planet?
You certainly whine about it enough.
Colonel Petigar
will be making those decisions.
Now, I want everyone
on their best behavior this evening.
I look forward to seeing that.
Company, halt!
Squad, halt!
Let them pass.
Quick, march!
Get ready. I think I hear two coming.
Let's go.
You were right.
I'm not tired at all.
Tighten up.
All right, listen up!
Squads One, Two, and Four,
you're here for the night.
Get comfortable.
I want no surprises.
Squad Three, standby.
You'll be joining the return escort
with the Commandant and his family.
If you don't bother them,
they won't bother you.
So I want mouths shut and eyes open.
Corporal.
Right turn.
With me.
Squad, halt!
Everybody ready?
Ah, the skin?
We trade goat hides
for a three-year lease.
If they didn't smell so badly,
it might be amusing.
Come on, you two.
The Dhanis have a rough appetite
for fragrance.
Yes, I've been warned.
A bit of ceremonial nonsense,
and we can tuck into a fine table.
Above the stench.
Has she checked in?
Not yet.
Problem?
She'll be there.
Wrong time to mess up.
They were supposed to call us!
- When are you gonna learn?
- We were waiting!
You were waiting?
That's your excuse?
You should know better.
Don't let Gorn catch you.
<i>Alkenzi Wing Seven.</i>
<i>Eastern sweep completed.</i>
<i>Returning to base.</i>
Attention!
Corporal.
Sir.
These men from Alkenzi?
Yes, sir.
- You do the talking, eh?
- Yes, sir.
Let's make quick work of it.
Where is she? We're late.
Random.
Alkenzi?
No, they're shutting down right now.
Everything's grounded.
No one wants to be up in this.
Vel, get down.
It's solid?
Call them.
You're sure?
You're stalling.
<i>Echo-One.</i>
<i>Echo-One.</i>
<i>Echo-One. Echo.</i>
Echo-One.
<i>Echo-One.</i>
<i>Echo-One.</i>
Valley-One.
<i>Valley-One at go.</i>
Call it.
Are you on point?
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>We're here on point.</i>
Are we going or not?
Vel.
Go.
<i>We go.</i>
Copy.
He says,
"May The Eye find the good in all of us."
Indeed.
Tell him we'll give him the gift
of our absence and be on our way.
- Corporal.
- At your service.
Fall in.
Right turn.
With me.
Sir.
- Everything in order?
- Yes, sir.
You take the point
and send your men down.
I want no one up here
without my permission.
Will do, sir.
You know, it's the old ones
causing all the problems.
Always trying to...
It'll all be much easier.
The days of passing skins
and ritual nonsense
will be soon behind us.
No great loss there.
It's not as if
there's much Aldhani civilization
to even forget about in the first place.
- Drop it. On the floor.
- What's all this?
- No!
- Drop it there.
Where's Lieutenant Gorn?
Down, on the ground. Down.
- What's the meaning of this?
- Be quiet!
- Move.
- Please.
- This is an outrage!
- Quiet! Stop talking!
Stop right there.
Let the boy go.
- Let the boy go!
- Jayhold...
Colonel, please.
Nobody has to die.
Everything all right, sir?
All good.
You can join your men
at the bottom of the hill now.
Enjoy the Eye.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
You'll never get out of here.
We're good.
- You do everything they tell you.
- Just what are you after?
You'll be taking us
to the payroll vault.
- That's insane.
- Or we die together.
- I can't open the vault.
- Time check.
- Falling behind.
- Go. We'll finish.
Didn't you hear me?
I don't control the vault!
It's on a code from the air base.
It's done remotely.
Keep lying
and it'll be a short night for you.
We know how the vault works.
We need your hand to key the sensor.
We can take just that if you'd prefer.
You'll never make it out.
- You better pray we do.
- You have no idea...
One path! One choice.
We win, or everyone dies.
Starts now.
Jayhold, please just do what they say.
Welcome, sir.
Put them down.
Down!
Against the wall. Move.
Move!
Down.
Sorry, just having a problem
with the comms.
Try the inverse channel.
Hands away from the console.
Get up, now!
Move!
Let's go! Move!
Lights. Parapet.
Base Floods. Turrets. Launch Tunnel.
Comms, you know.
This?
Don't touch, that's Alkenzi,
that's the Air Base Link.
You're coming with us.
Everyone else stays here.
Your comms have been disabled.
Ours are working.
If you don't help us,
your family will die.
If you slow us down,
if you stall, if you argue,
if you play us in anyway, they will die.
You'll kill us anyway.
'Cause that's what you'd do, right?
No.
If we get what we came for,
everyone walks away.
But if we go down,
you're right there with us.
- 14 minutes.
- Move.
Tell me you'll be all right.
I'll be fine.
Go.
Are you having trouble with your comms?
It just went down.
The Alkenzi line is still open,
but everything else is fried.
Weird, right?
Must be the Eye.
Clem out first.
Clear.
Vel, take him.
Move.
Clem, with me.
- Forty credits.
- I'm in.
Deal.
Hexba.
Hexa.
Hoxla.
- Come on.
- Oh, come on.
Commandant on the floor!
Commandant inspection!
- Muster up! Let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Line it up!
Move!
Hands on heads!
Hands on your heads!
Drop it! Now!
- Out! Out!
- This is not an inspection,
- it is a robbery!
- Move!
They've taken
the tower and communications.
They're holding hostages,
including my wife and son.
Move!
They've already killed, and I am sure
that they will do so again,
which is why I am urging you to cooperate.
Enough! Move! Move!
Hey!
You are gonna load us out
as fast as possible.
Anyone doesn't want to hustle
for the next ten minutes, raise your hand.
All right, up! Up! Up! Up! Let's go!
Two men to a trolley. Let's go!
You got power?
Yeah, I do indeed.
Let's go! Move! Move! Move!
I can't unlock the trays.
It takes a signal from Alkenzi.
- Get with the others.
- I only control the gate!
- Move!
- They won't open!
Do you hear me?
I don't control the vault!
Get ready.
Fire in the hole!
They're in.
Go. I'm almost done.
I'll be right behind you.
Let's go!
- Let's go! You, here! Move, move! Move!
- You, up there! Move! You up there!
<i>Echo-One. Echo-One,
on spot. Echo-One. Echo-One, on spot.</i>
Valley-One. Loud and clear.
<i>We've taken the vault
and breached the vault door...</i>
<i>In... Repeat. We're in...
the freighter now.</i>
<i>Copy that. All good up here.</i>
<i>Get ready.
Alkenzi should be calling in soon.</i>
<i>Will do. Valley-One out.</i>
Come on!
Come on!
- Load!
- Out of the way!
- Come on! All the way around!
- Move! Bring it in!
Get it turned around! Move! Move!
You're taking too long!
Let's go! Let's go!
- Go! Get out! Out! Out! Okay!

- Faster! Get it round and moving!
- Move! Move! Come on, move!
<i>Tower One,
this is Alkenzi Wing Command.</i>
<i>Requesting status rep.</i>
<i>We have a vault-breach indicator
lighting up over here.</i>
<i>Tower One, please respond.</i>
<i>A vault-breach indicator light

Where are we going?
Heading to the vault.
But we'll miss the Eye.
Move! Let's go!
- Let's go! Move! Move! Move!
- Move!
Bring 'em in, bring 'em in. Keep loading!
- Come on!
- Now! Now!
Move, move, move!
All right! Move! Let's go!
- Keep moving!
- Come on!
- Go, go, go!

- Keep loadin'!
- Let's go!
- Faster!
- Come on.
- Move! Move!
- Come on! Faster! Move!
- Move!
- Get loading!
- Get it on. Come on.
Come on!
- Move!
- That's it. Let's go!
All right, got it.
Move, move! Move! Move!
Keep moving! Keep moving.
Go! Move around him! Move!
Time check!
Five-nine.
Faster! Faster! Faster!
Come on! Let's go! Come on!
Watch yourselves!
It's a long way down!
Almost home! Everyone can go home!
Let's move!
Move!
Right, get it out! Out!
What are you doing?
You're still loading?
We have two minutes.
I was afraid you'd be leaving!
We need to be locking up!
Easy there... Yeah...
Quickly, quickly...
You.
Quit gawking and get pushing.
Close it down! Let's go! Last call!
You'll hang for this.
Seven years serving you?
I deserve worse than that.
Are we good to go?
We're good.
Okay, come on! Come on!
Are you crazy?
Just leave it! Get this thing in the air!
What's going on here?
You're off your post, Corporal.
Sorry, sir, but...
This is a classified mission,
and you're not cleared to be here.
Commandant?
Tell him, sir. Tell him he needs to leave.
Sir?
I am giving you a direct order, Corporal!
What is going on here?
Sir...
- Go and get us ready!
- Cover me!
Now!
I'm pinned down!
Cover me!
No!
Where's Taramyn?
Get this thing in the air!
Go! Go! Go!
Hang on!
- No!
- Nemik!
No! No! No!
Lift him!
I can't feel my legs. I can't,
I can't feel my legs.
- Nemik.
- Hey.
Nemik, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
I need a flight path.
He's hurt! Hold on!
- What are you doing?
- Hold him still.
What is that?
- Med-spike. Keep him still.
- Go, go, go.
No.
Where am I heading? I need numbers!
Hold on!
I'm flying blind!
Climb!
Climb? Look out the window.
Climb. Full climb now!
What did you give him?
I'm pegged here!
I don't have the speed to make it!
And now you want me to climb?
Climb!
Dive!
Vector six-five-five-five-one.
Full boost thrust on level!
Come on!
I need to know where we're going.
Is he still with us?
Yeah, you disappointed?
That's not fair.
Where are we heading?
- She wants to bail on him.
- He's dying.
You don't know that.
There's a doctor.
We have it built into the contingency.
She doesn't want to
jeopardize the mission.
This kid, I mean,
this kid is the reason that we are here.
He's alive.
How do we get to the doctor?
You think he'll make it?
He could get lucky.
Yeah, luck.
It drives the whole damn galaxy,
doesn't it?
You wanna guess how much is in there?
Eighty million, give or take.
What'd you tell me?
You wanna win and walk away.
Well...
forty million apiece.
Don't tell me you haven't
thought about it.
See, I can't fly the trawler,
but I do have a safe place we can hole up.
Between the two of us,
we could be the winners here.
So no rebellion for you?
Oh, I'm a rebel. It's just, uh...
me against everybody else.
Where would that put me?
Forty million credits is enough
for me to forget all about you.
Your brother, with the orchard?
I don't have a brother.
So just leave them here?
Don't play the high mind with me.
You're not here to save
anybody but yourself.
I saw it the first minute
you came into camp.
You're like me, we were born in the hole,
all we know is climbing
over somebody else to get out.
There's a moon eight parsecs
from here with nobody home.
Put that thing down,
catch our breath,
split up the winnings, and walk...
Thank you. Thank you for trying.
I did everything I could.
It's not you, Doc.
And it's not what you think, either.
Oh, surprise me.
I'll give you 30,000 credits
for the ship in the barn.
That's twice what it's worth.
Excuse me?
Where's Skeen?
Skeen! Skeen!
He's dead.
He wanted to take the money
and leave you here.
He wouldn't do that.
You're gonna have to think about that.
You disgusting bastard.
Taramyn warned me.
I'm taking my cut.
The number I was promised.
I'm leaving you the freighter
and what's inside.
I did my job.
I'm done.
And I wouldn't stick around if I were you.
Return this to your friend.
Wait.
Nemik's manifesto.
He said to give this to you.
I don't want it.
He insisted.
Don't get comfortable.
This is not a meeting.
No one is going home.
Tell your staff, tell your families.
I want every Star Sector
and Planetary Emergency Retaliation plan
in the building ready
for presentation by midnight.
Senator Dhow's proposal
is both temperate and timely,
far more reasoned and thoughtful
than the calls for decree
we've been hearing from the other side.
There will be a fact-finding commission
put in place this session,
and it will prove
that this is a boot to the throats
of all Ghormans,
who've done nothing more than
request their basic rights.
My bill assails the coarse
and blatant domination
of a peaceful and faithful ally.
<i>The blue is lovely.</i>
It's a Devaron blue.
There's an inscription on that one.
In a language no one remembers.
How sad.
No, it's liberating.
You decide what it says.
Your own secret language.
Got anything from Aldhani?
Excuse me?
Aldhani.
Big rebel attack last night.
It's all the news.
I'll have to look.
Maybe we have something in the back.
Really? I was kidding.

Wouldn't you rather give it all at once
to something real?
What would we be stealing?
The quarterly payroll
for an entire Imperial sector.
<i>If I was them,
this is how I'd do it.</i>
I'd spread it out.
Never climb the same fence twice.
Bix!
Who did this?
Timm!
<i>So you think it's hopeless, do you?</i>
Freedom? Independence?
We should just submit and be thankful?
Do I look thankful to you?
- Corporal.
- At your service.
Fall in.
Turn.
With me.
Tell me you'll be all right.
I'll be fine.
Go.
Let's go!
What is going on here?
I'm pinned down!
No!
Hang on!
<i>My assumption is,
you have no prospect for the future.</i>
I'm calling Uncle Harlo.
I'm calling in the family favor.
You wanna guess how much is in there?
Forty million a piece, give or take.
- So no rebellion for you?
- Oh, I'm a rebel. It's just, uh...
me against everybody else.
He wanted to take the money
and leave you here.
- He wouldn't do that.
- I'm taking my cut.
I did my job.
I found someone I think can help me.
We're vulnerable enough.
We need funding, not more people.
Don't lecture me on vulnerability.
No one's more at risk than I am.
Syril?
Syril!
Is that what you're wearing?
It would seem so.
What makes you believe
the Bureau of Standards
is in the market for individuals?
It's a brown suit.
It's your interview.
Perhaps, you would like to come along.
Uncle Harlo's influence
is not a thing to be trifled with.
How am I trifling?
He's done us a tremendous favor.
You need to remember you're not just
representing yourself today.
It's a brown suit.
The collar.
- What about it?
- It's high.
You've had it raised.
I had it tailored.
Everything says something, Syril.
I've tried to make you understand that,
you've resisted.
What is it
that you hear my collar saying?
"Look at me.
"I don't believe in myself.
"I am desperate for approval."
<i>We have
distressing reports are reaching us</i>
<i>that a terror attack and robbery</i>
<i>have taken place
at the Imperial Armory on Aldhani,</i>
<i>with multiple fatalities reported.</i>
What happened?
- Rabble.
<i>- ...a Blockade Order was issued...</i>
They attacked a garrison.
They'll regret it.
<i>...officials on the scene
are still assessing the loss</i>
<i>and searching for the conspirators.</i>
<i>The criminals responsible
for last night's atrocity on Aldhani</i>
<i>think they've taken
the Empire by surprise.</i>
<i>We know better.</i>
We know the real shock will be
when they discover how ready
and eager we are to respond,
<i>to be prepared, to be here this morning</i>
<i>and know that the only question</i>
<i>we need to answer
is how tight to close our fist.</i>
<i>This is why we plan.</i>
<i>This is why we work so hard
when we're at peace.</i>
<i>This is why we recruit so carefully
and demand so much.</i>
The following measures
will be adopted Empire-wide as of today.
A tribute tax equal to five times
the amount stolen from Aldhani
will be levied on any sector
harboring partisan activity.
We will make it clear
that no one steals from the Empire.
The use of any local custom, festival,
or tradition as cover for rebel activity
will trigger permanent revocation
of Imperial tolerance.
I spoke with Emperor Palpatine last night,
and he's assured me that the ISB
will be taking the lead going forward.
No one in this room
should have trouble accessing
Army or Naval resources in future.
The Emperor will be convening
an emergency session of the Senate
to propose a legislation package
of bills and amendments
that will free our hands in all matters
of surveillance, search, and seizure.
We will be invoking the Public Order
Resentencing Directive later today.
P-O-R-D.
Any criminal act,
with even indirect effect on the Empire,
will henceforth be branded
a Class One Offense.
All prison sentences
are immediately re-evaluated.
All outstanding fines and levies
are to be paid in full.
- I have assured the Emperor...
<i>- You're not pleased.</i>
<i>We're playing
straight into their hands.</i>
- Whose hands?
- The rebels.
This is exactly what they want.
We're treating what happened
at Aldhani like a robbery.
What would you call it?
An announcement.
<i>Preliminary investigation puts the loss</i>
<i>at over eighty million credits.</i>
<i>All military personnel
at the garrison have been replaced</i>
<i>and are being interrogated by ISB.</i>
<i>ISB confirms the tracking devices</i>
<i>in the escape craft were disabled
prior to it reaching hyperspace.</i>
<i>134 Aldhani residents
have been taken into custody</i>
<i>under suspicion
of abetting the terrorists.</i>
Mon Mothma.
Without warning?
Wipe the smile off your face.
I should've called.
We're on our way to the Senate,
I realized we'd be passing by.
- I'll be right back.
- Ma'am.
Perrin likes it,
I'm just not sure he loves it.
- Ah.
- I think I might want the other one.
Was this you?
What do you mean?
The garrison. Aldhani.
Ah! Is it true?
Kleya was just...
I've been worried
you might do something like this.
How I wish I had.
Let's have a look.
I don't believe you.
- Well, you'll have to try harder.
- Don't you dare talk to me like that.
Revolutions are expensive.
I told you, I'm doing everything I can.
Your "everything"
seemed to be all about
bringing in a savior
to access your family funds.
It was you, wasn't it?
I explained to you the risk of new faces,
but you seemed to know better.
You realize what you've done?
I thought you were here
to tell me about the meeting.
It's tonight.
They may reschedule.
I warned you when we started.
- You told me we were building a network.
- What were my words?
This is something else entirely.
"Turning back will be impossible."
You knew where this was going.
You've always known.
Has anyone ever made a weapon
that wasn't used?
The network's been built. It's up.
It grows or it dies.
<i>We've waited long enough.</i>
<i>You realize what you've set in motion?</i>
<i>It was time for that as well.</i>
<i>- Palpatine won't hesitate now.</i>
- Exactly!
We need it.
We need the fear.
- We need them to overreact.
- You can't be serious.
The Empire has been choking us
so slowly, we're starting not to notice.
The time has come to force their hand.
People will suffer.
That's the plan.
You're not angry at me.
I'm just saying out loud
what you already know.
There will be no rules going forward.
If you're not willing
to risk your conscience,
then surrender and be done with it.
We need every credit
we can get our hands on.
Let me know how the meeting goes.
I'm afraid I won't be taking
either of these pieces this morning.
I'll have some new things
coming in very, very soon.
I'll be sure to come by.
Always at your service, Senator.
Always at your service.
I hope she's worth it.
<i>Well, we'll see, won't we?</i>
We can't hide forever.
People all think we're kidding
when we say it, but it's true.
There are no small jobs
at the Bureau Of Standards.
I spoke with your uncle.
Some sectors might naturally appear
more exciting from the outside.
Weights and Gauges
may seem a more vibrant arena
than Redundancy or Verification,
but walk the floor,
talk to any lifetime employee,
you'll be surprised.
I'm sure.
Morlana One.
Yes, uh...
There's a rebel murderer running free
because of corruption and laxity
in the corporate authority.
I was punished
for trying to uphold the law.
Do my job. Maintain public safety.
Two men dead.
Co-workers.
I believe that we have laws for a reason.
I fully intend to clear my name
and have my record expunged.
Why don't we start that process now?
Probably best for everyone to just edit
this a bit before signing you in.
I'm sure your uncle would approve.
Fresh start, eh?
New beginnings.
We just happen to have
an immediate opening in Fuel Purity.
I'd hate to see you miss your chance.
<i>Exit right for the Senate level.</i>
<i>Exit left for the downtown, midtown level.</i>
<i>Four-nine vector six.</i>
<i>L-U-H-three-four-one.</i>
<i>Security clearance code...</i>
- The food is superb.
- It's quite exquisite...
- At ease, Attendant.
- Yes, sir.
Ma'am. Sir.
Your tunic.
Sorry, sir. Ma'am.
Sorry.
What is your name?
Felzonis.
Attendant Felzonis.
Hmm. I need a Multi-Sector Data Blend
going back two years.
The survey pool is Imperial Naval bases
and repair facilities.
I want a record of all missing avionics,
comm, navigation, and targeting equipment.
For which star system?
All star systems.
Is that a problem?
I'll need this report kept confidential
and a copy sent exclusively to my office.
Can I rely on you
for that level of discretion?
Absolutely.
Yes. Can do.
Will do.
Will do.
Right. Get on with it.
Where is he?
I shouldn't even be here.
Neither of us should.
The money's safe.
We know.
It's been moved already.
You've done exceptional work.
It's the trawler
that we're more worried about.
It's buried. Gone for good.
- You're sure?
- Yes.
He read your message.
I really thought he'd be here.
Every loss is different.
Every one's the same.
I recruited Taramyn myself.
Nemik, Gorn, they'll all be remembered.
That's it?
He had doubts about Skeen.
It's one less thing to worry about.
Have you heard from Cinta?
She's doing what she was told.
Receiving messages
is just as dangerous as sending them.
You should keep that in mind.
We have a loose end.
Cassian Andor, who you know as Clem.
You need to find him.
Find him?
We can't have him walking around
with Luthen in his head.
You mean kill him.
This is what revolution looks like, Vel.
We'll send you what we have on him.
Who's there?
I hear you!
Just, just hold on!
- Cassian.
- Oh! Get in here.
- Since when do we lock the door?
- Oh!
Where have you been?
Look at you.
You can't stay here, Cass. It's not safe.
There is t-t-troopers now.
- That was fast.
- Yeah, they came the next day.
Kicked out Pre-Mor, took over the hotel.
Ferrix is under Imperial authority.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone turned me in.
You don't know?
Know what?
- T-T-Timm.
- What?
Timm Karlo turned you in.
No point in stewing over it,
he's dead now.
The Corpos killed him
when they were coming after you.
How do you know all this?
Everyone knows it.
- Bix knew about it?
- No.
She was coming to warn you,
and Timm was trying to stop her,
or to catch her, I don't know.
I've... I've heard both.
But you can't be here, Cass.
The Imperials are here to stay.
They're not going away this time.
It's all come undone.
We won't have to worry about that.
What are you talking about?
We're getting out of here.
We're leaving.
To go where?
Anywhere we want.
I got lucky.
I scored.
I've got enough credits
to get us anywhere.
We're gonna clear out.
Leave this mess behind.
When d-d-do we go?
- We go tonight.
- Tonight?
Yeah, why not?
What do we need to take
but the three of us?
Huh? Get out of the cold and damp.
Find somewhere warm and easy.
I can make it happen.
It's all gonna be different now, Ma.
What's wrong?
Just such a lot to take in.
No one knows I'm here.
We take what we can carry,
and we disappear.
It's just such a big idea,
you know, I... I get so tired.
You surprised me.
What am I thinking?
It's... It's late.
Yeah, yeah. You... You gotta rest.
I'll check up on Bix, and we'll pull out
first thing in the morning.
- All right?
- F-F-First thing.
- Let's do that.
- Ah.
Thank you.
Sorry we're not having dinner.
How long are you staying?
I'm back to Chandrila tomorrow.
I haven't been home all year.
You haven't missed much.
I've missed you.
You always seem to be away when I'm there.
I'm not that hard to find, Mon.
Not for a Senator.
You're right.
- I've been a poor friend.
- No, that's not what I meant.
Life takes us where it will.
You've become all this. All these years.
We're both a long way
from where we started.
Have I changed so much?
- We've all had to adapt.
- Is it that bad?
I just can't imagine living here, Mon.
Like this.
Coruscant.
No escape.
Just this glimpse of what it's like here,
what you have to do.
It can be challenging.
You carry it gracefully.
Can I trust you, Tay?
Can I call back our old kinship
and share some truth with you?
Mother.
Leida.
- Do you remember my daughter?
- Of course.
This is Tay Kolma,
one of my oldest friends.
How do you do?
You've met before.
Bank Of Kolma?
You know Adrine and Marsa from back home.
- My sisters.
- Um, I'm not sure.
It's been a long time,
and you've certainly grown up.
So everyone says.
Typical banker.
No one pays me to be original.
Oh. Father said I needed to ask you
if I may be excused.
Yes.
You're excused.
- Lovely seeing you again.
- Uh, yes. Have fun, Mother.
Another part of the challenge.
It's a difficult age.
I've spent a great deal of time
thinking about this conversation, Tay.
I want to tell you something
that only three people
in the galaxy know about.
Why would you want to do that?
Because I need your help.
And I'm hoping I can trust you.
Is this personal or political?
Political.
- Then I'd suggest you hesitate.
- Why?
Like I said, we've both changed.
I've done more
than grow weary of the Empire.
I'm afraid you'd find my politics
a bit strong for your taste.
Your world is inescapably
linked to the Empire.
You're with these people all the time.
I'm not sure
you're aware how far afield
some of us have taken
our political allegiances these days.
Sorry, I think I've had too much
of Perrin's Embassy punch.
Drink up.
Drink up, Tay, and keep smiling
as if we're having
a happy chat about childhood days.
I'm not sure I understand.
No, you don't.
What you see, what people say about me,
it's a clear picture, isn't it?
I'm a polite, sometimes-indecisive Senator
who spends her days fighting and failing
to protect Separatist do-gooders
and battle Empire overreach.
An irritation, as you so harshly put it.
- I've made you angry, I...
- No, no. You've set me free.
I've been wondering all day
how I could be sure of confiding in you.
I don't know what we're talking about.
It's a lie.
The Mon Mothma
people think they know, it's a lie.
It's a projection.
It's a front.
Smile.
I've learned from Palpatine.
I show you the stone in my hand,
you miss the knife at your throat.
Where is this going, Mon?
The Grand Vizier has infiltrated
my Separatist Coalition meetings.
My driver is an ISB plant and reports
on my secret humanitarian programs.
They know they watch me, and I want that,
because as long as everyone
thinks I'm an irritation,
there's a good chance
they'll miss what I'm really doing.
What are you really doing?
Raising money.
I need to access my family accounts.
Until recently,
I was able to dip in and out of
my family fortune without concern.
That's changed.
I need help.
Raising money for what?
I'm forming a Chandrilan
charitable outreach program.
I'll ask you to be chairman.
It will involve visits here to Coruscant.
It will appear to be another
of my benevolent and useless irritations.
I've explored the alternatives.
You're my best shot.
You haven't answered my question.
And I won't.
You're better off not knowing.
Or perhaps, you'd find my politics
a bit strong for your taste.
Perrin's on his way over.
He knows none of this.
He's not to be trusted.
Smile.
There you are.
Reminiscing, are we? School days?
Are we that predictable?
- There's a reunion coming up.
- Oh, don't remind me.
She pretends not to care,
but we both know better, don't we?
It was ever thus.
May I steal her back? There's a few guests
that require special handling.
Of course.
To be continued.
Hey.
<i>Cass?</i>
Hey.
<i>What are you doing here?</i>
Remember when your father caught me
climbing over that wall?
<i>This is the last place you should be.</i>
I think those
were his exact words.
<i>It's not safe here.</i>
Timm?
<i>I guess he thought
you and I were back together.</i>
Why would he think that?
<i>You can't be as surprised as I was.</i>
What happened to you?
I ran into a wall, like I do.
You can't be here, Cass.
Troopers won't catch me.
Not here.
They won't have to.
You'll be turned in.
- By who?
- By who?
By anyone.
People blame you for what happened.
Blame me?
You killed two Corpos
and came home to hide.
Put the entire town at risk.
- Now there's Imperials on the street.
- If Timm had kept his mouth shut.
If this, if that. If you, if me, if Timm.
We were doing a deal you...
You scam, you borrow,
you lie, you disappear.
Your crazy boyfriend tries
to get me killed, and I'm the villain?
You need to get as far away
from here as you can.
Wow.
I will.
I am.
You won't have to worry about me anymore.
I need to know about the other guy.
The buyer, who is he?
- I don't know.
- You're lying.
I'm not.
Paak introduced us,
but swears he doesn't know either.
I have a comm. I call. I wait.
Sometimes they respond.
He knew all about me. How?
I... I don't know.
And you're right, he did know.
He knew that the Corpos were on you.
But not from me.
You ever talk to him again,
tell him I held up my end of the deal,
and he needs to forget about me.
And that goes for everybody.
I've done it before.
12,000 credits.
That's everything I owe.
Xan, Nurchi, Brasso, Deema.
Twelve should cover it.
Be careful, Cass.
You too.
This is not our fight, Cass.
Don't worry.
They won't be here long.
They're just gonna raise
their silly flag and fly away.
Long live the Republic!
Free Ferrix!
Don't move. Stay here.
Hey, guys! Calm down!
- You're only making things worse!
- Halt!
Turn!
Ready arms!
M-M-Maarva.
He's b-b-back.
I was coming to find you.
Here I am.
You haven't done much packing.
She says we can't go.
Bee. Quiet.
What is this?
I'm not going.
What are you talking about?
I'm staying.
But it's... it's not safe.
I know all that.
I can't be here.
You said it yourself,
"It's all come undone."
There's an Imperial barracks on Rix Road.
Good luck to them.
- You wanna live under that?
- It's happening everywhere.
Well, we'll find a place
they haven't ruined yet.
I'm already there.
That place is in my head.
They can build as many barracks
as they like, they'll never find me.
What's left to keep you here?
The Rebellion.
What?
Ferrix has been hiding long enough.
So now you're taking on the Empire?
Laugh if you want to.
Who's laughing? This is madness.
No, it's not.
It's overdue, and probably doomed,
and I'm too old, and I don't care anymore.
For 13 years,
every time I walk down Rix Road,
I turn off before I get to the square.
I take the long way around
so I don't have to think
about Clem hanging there.
Then yesterday,
I heard about this attack at Aldhani.
Have you heard about this?
What about it?
Well, Bee played me the news.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
<i>Yeah, yeah,
the garrison at Aldhani.</i>
I heard that, I put on my best coat,
and I walked across the square
with a smile on my face.
If there are heroes brave enough
to take on a whole Imperial garrison,
I'm brave enough to stick it out here.
I... I don't expect you to understand.
Aldhani was just a robbery.
People are standing up.
Yeah, and getting killed for it.
But there's work that will need doing.
Yeah? What is that?
Whatever it takes.
I've been lying around
waiting to die long enough.
You can't beat them, Maarva.
Not if I run away.
You have a different path, Cass,
and I am not judging you.
Everything you've been through,
everything that was taken away from you
before you even started?
Take all the money you've found
and go and find some peace.
I won't have peace.
I'll be worried about you all the time.
That's just love.
Nothing you can do about that.
I've never loved anything
the way I love you,
and I've never fretted on anything more,
but this time...
you can't stay, and I can't go.
- C-C-Can I speak now?
- No!
Tell me you understand.
I don't.
You will. You'll see.
And just one more thing... Just...
Stop searching for your sister.
It's a fantasy.
There were no survivors on Kenari.
What happened there
was not your responsibility.
You were a child.
Let it go.
I'm coming back.
Of course you are.
The alternative analysis is that
by comparing the detention numbers
to the frequency of surprise inspections
we're under-allocating
our harbor patrol units.
So, three theories, Mr. Jung?
Yes, sir.
Three possible explanations
for why you have failed to keep pace
with your neighboring sectors.
- That's correct.
- I'm correct?
Your approval is heartening.
Your guidance would be welcome, sir.
Very well, let's have a full audit
of all hyperspace lanes
leading to Ord Mantell
on my desk by this time tomorrow.
As you wish.
- Mr. Blevin.
- Sir.
I sense something eager
in you this morning.
Am I mistaken?
No, sir. And at risk
of repetition, you are correct.
Good news, is it?
I'm afraid not.
I wish to lodge a charge
against a fellow supervisor.
Proceed.
I believe our Sector Protocols,
as described in the ISB Code Of Conduct,
are being violated by Supervisor Meero,
and that this overreach,
for which she was previously reprimanded,
risks compromising Imperial safety
to a degree that silence
is no longer possible.
You think this forum appropriate?
I do.
It's a serious charge.
I believe
you'll share my sense of urgency.
Supervisor Meero,
do you mind having your integrity
ventilated in public?
No, sir.
Supervisor Blevin obviously finds
my conduct a more interesting subject
than the advancement
of Integrated Imperial Security.
He's put a lot into it,
I'm curious to hear his insights.
This is Ferrix, is it not?
Yes, sir.
Your sector.
There was an unusual piece
of Naval equipment recovered.
Meero wanted your crime reports.
You determined her request
was out of order
- and in violation of the chain of command.
- That's not accurate.
You advised me
to reinforce my suspicions with data
and to be careful
in my work going forward.
Careful?
Is that your defense?
You've been "careful"?
I'd be curious
how many people at this table
will think it "careful" that you've found
a way to access our sector data
without ever filing a request.
Is that true, Dedra?
Yes.
I used the Imperial Emergency Act
in the wake of Aldhani
to gather data across multiple sectors
without official sanction.
But that is the wrong question.
I'd like to know if anyone here believes
the Rebellion plans its actions
around the artificially constructed
boundaries of our sectors.
Major Partagaz created those sectors.
As organizing principles,
not personal playthings.
Do you think the rebels care
about the lines we draw on maps?
You think the relevance of my work
has been supplanted?
Systems either change or die.
Sir.
Thesis, please.
There is a focused,
organized rebel effort
to acquire highly-restricted
Imperial military components.
Your evidence?
By accessing unfiltered
Sector Crime Reports
I can now prove a link between the theft
of our most secret equipment
and its distribution
to rebel groups across the galaxy.
This is hard, verifiable data
you are prepared to present?
Yes, sir.
I believe Supervisor Blevin is aware
I have a documented file ready to go.
I believe his accusations
here this morning
have more to do with self-preservation
than any sense of urgency.
What's more urgent
than a renegade intelligence officer?
Imagine if everyone in this room played
as loose with the rules as you.
Excellent suggestion, Blevin.
I'm wondering where we'd be right now
if everyone here
showed the same endeavor
as Supervisor Meero.
I'll have to think about that.
For the moment, I'm reassigning
the Morlana sector to Supervisor Meero.
Ferrix is of great interest to her
and has clearly
become a distraction for you.
I see no urgent problem,
but, as always,
I salute the provocative
exchange of ideas.
Supervisor Grandi,
you will accelerate your schedule.
Jung, I will expect your report
on Ord Mantell tomorrow.
Thank you all for the lively session.
Dedra, if you'd walk with me a moment.
Well-played.
Thank you, sir.
Watch your back.
Keef.
Keef?
I'll be out in a minute.
What're you doing?
Washing up.
I'm gonna take a walk.
Well, we need stuff.
Arkie's up the beach.
He'll be open.
I was planning to go the other way.
Mmm, Arkie has the new flavors.
And we need Peezos.
Don't forget the Peezos.
We ran out of Peezos?
Peezos and Revnog.
The greenie green ones.
The greenie Revnog.
You liked it, too.
Keef? Are you listening?
Ah.
Go! Go! Run!
Go, go, go, go!
Hey, you! Stop!
Hold it!
Freeze!
What are you doing?
- Excuse me?
- You keep looking around.
Just trying to figure out what's going on.
You a part of it?
Part of what?
Don't play dumb.
No, I'm on my way to the store.
Back up.
Stand right there.
You look like you're sweating.
- Well, it's hot.
- Or you've been running.
Why would I be running?
Because you're a part of it.
Part of what?
- I'll ask the questions.
- Go! Run!
Pier Nine, Pier Nine,
runners heading south!
Move it! Go!
I can wait for you here, if you want.
Friends of yours?
- What?
- You heard me.
Wait, no... Uh...
I don't know anybody here.
I'm a tourist.
Tourists don't run.
But I'm not running.
You got that right.
That window is shut.
I'm just going to the store.
It's right there.
You need to calm down, sir.
Droid assistance, please.
Uh... What? Wait. What is he...
No, this is crazy.
Hang onto this one for me.
I wanna check the shelter.
He said hang?
No, no, no. No.
No, you misunderstand.
No, he... he meant watch.
- Hang?
- No, no, he means watch.
Hang.
Tell him!
Tell him you mean watch!
Charges?
Loitering at a crime scene.
Walking an unleashed massif.
Animal fouling.
Four months.
Next.
Keef Girgo?
Keef Girgo!
Here.
- Name?
- Hey, uh, Keef Girgo.
- Charges?
- Civil Disruption.
- Anti-Imperial speech.
- No. No.
Fleeing the scene
of anti-Imperial activity.
Attempted damage...
- I... I'm sorry, there's something wrong.
- I wouldn't.
You've got enough trouble
without a Resisting Judgement charge.
I'm just a tourist.
Oh, apologies all around then.
This used to be a six-month sentence.
Six years.
- Six years?
- Six years?
- No, no, wait!
- Take him.
- Change of guidelines.
- Take him away.
- I didn't do anything! Hey!
- Take it up with the Emperor.
Wait. I'm just a tourist!
- Next.
- Wait!

They're in.
<i>- We're getting out of here.</i>
- To go where?
Anywhere we want.
I got lucky.
I've got enough credits
to get us anywhere.
We're treating what happened
at Aldhani like a robbery.
What would you call it?
An announcement.
You realize what you've set in motion?
People will suffer.
That's the plan.
<i>I hope she's worth it.</i>
<i>Well, we'll see, won't we?</i>
We can't hide forever.
I can now prove a link between the theft
of our most secret equipment
and its distribution
to rebel groups across the galaxy.
For the moment, I'm reassigning
the Morlana Sector to Supervisor Meero.
Ferrix is of great interest to her
and has clearly
become a distraction for you.
<i>As long as everyone
thinks I'm an irritation,</i>
<i>they might miss what I'm really doing.</i>
What are you really doing?
Raising money.
Raising money for what?
I'm not going.
What are you talking about?
You can't stay, and I can't go.
<i>Morlana One.</i>
I fully intend to clear my name
and have my record expunged.
Why don't we start that process now?
<i>There's a rebel murderer
running free</i>
<i>because of corruption and laxity
in the authority.</i>
Hang onto this one for me.
Six years.
Six years?
No, no, wait!
Change of guidelines.
I didn't do anything!
Wait. I'm just a tourist!
Get in line!
Move it!
Don't you look at me!
Move it!
Keep moving!
Up the stairs!
Pick it up!
Name?
Tuck Hybecks.
- Home planet?
- Galdi.
Belsavis. Next.
Name?
Girgo. Keef Girgo.
- Home planet?
- Deris-plata.
Narkina Five.
What? What's that?
Get to your transport.
- Next.
- What is that?
What's Narkina Five?
I'm a tourist!
Move it.
- Home planet?
- Giermos.
Belsavis.
Right there.
On you go.
Come on, move it, move it.
Anywhere, come on, sit down!
Right, shoes off!
Boots, sandals, everything on the floor!
Toss it in!
Come on, move it, bare feet, let's go!
I'm Lieutenant Dedra Meero.
I'm the ISB Supervisor
for the Morlana Sector.
What happened to Lieutenant Blevin?
I'll ask the questions.
Ferrix. I've been reviewing the incident.
I was planning on calling you in
to fill some gaps in the report.
We were scheduling that.
But now, we've both
had our mornings interrupted
because you keep requesting
the Bureau of Standards Data Center
to look for Cassian Andor.
You've claimed
he was a missing fuel specialist,
an unresponsive energy engineer,
a fuel purity field officer
suspected of forging Imperial reports.
You've been here for less than a month
and you've filed five false inquiries.
Six, actually.
I wasn't counting this morning.
What are you doing, Mr. Karn?
Cassian Andor is a murderer
and a threat to the Empire.
I have been trying, with the limited
tools available, to find him.
So, this is about public safety?
Here's what's happened, Syril.
You have engaged the curiosity of the ISB.
Now, is there anything
you'd care to tell me
before I waste more of my time
figuring out what it is you are up to?
I'm just trying to clear my name.
One would think
you'd want to leave Ferrix far behind.
One would be wrong.
I have a busy day.
Tell me, what's not in Lieutenant Blevin's
report that I need to know?
I have no idea.
I wasn't allowed to see the report.
- You signed it.
- I was given no choice.
We should be upstairs by now.
Give him Blevin's report, let him read it.
- Keep him in there.
- Of all days?
We have time.
This is an Imperial Starpath unit.
It was stolen
from the Steergard Naval yard last year.
We don't know when it was taken
because Steergard
was afraid to disclose its theft
and thought they could hide its absence.
My full report highlights the prevalence
of this problem galaxy-wide.
I'm listening.
This unit was found last month
on Ferrix in the Morlana One Sector.
The thief was a local named Cassian Andor.
He was wanted for the murder
of two Corporate Security officers.
The Starpath was left behind as he escaped
the tactical team sent in to arrest him.
Andor was in the act of transferring
the unit to a person we've named Axis
because of his centrality
to what we believe to be
an organized rebel effort
to acquire specialized Imperial gear.
This is quite the wishlist.
Full planetary comnet,
full Garrison tech package,
Series Nine Spectrum surveillance,
local agent funding, Code Droid.
All ready to go, sir.
If someone there is talking,
we need to be listening.
It's a large investment.
It's a fraction of the price
of lost technology.
So, drill down on Ferrix,
find this thief, and then what?
Identify Axis.
They escaped together.
It's the first best lead we've had.
Supervisor Meero has convinced me
that this Axis has been nimble
in spreading his activities
across the galaxy.
And, no, we don't know who he is,
nor do we know the scope of our problem.
The little we are aware
of is already troubling.
Ferrix was a mistake.
It's the first one he's made.
Drill down is exactly
what I want to do, sir.
Drill down, find Andor,
and get a hunt started.
All right, move!
Go!
Down the ramp!
Down the ramp, now!
Move it!
Stay right there!
On program!
Hands behind heads, feet down!
Breathe deep, brother.
This may be the last fresh air
we ever taste.
Welcome to Narkina Five.
This is an Imperial factory facility.
You've all been assessed as labor-worthy.
Now, following this introduction,
you'll be transferred
to your level assignment and workroom,
where your floor manager
will explain the details
of our schedule and expectations.
Your length of stay
has been predetermined.
The quality of that time
will be up to you.
Now, those who've been incarcerated
before will be surprised by the calm,
sanitary conditions, and our minimally
invasive enforcement techniques.
Well, I'm sure some,
if not all of you, are wondering,
how we risk standing
before you without weapons?
It's a potent question.
And hopefully, one you won't need
to have answered very often, but...
You may stand.
That was level one of three.
Our floors are Tunqstoid steel.
Do your time productively,
keep to your lane,
and this needn't be more than a memory.
Good luck to you.
Up!
Line up! Single file!
Up!
Let's go!
You've read the report?
Worse than I feared.
Criminal negligence
of my commanding officer,
the total lack
of Imperial authority on Ferrix,
the fact that Andor obviously had
an organized local cadre of accomplices.
None of that is here.
Let's talk about
the accomplice you encountered.
You told Lieutenant Blevin that Andor was
in the company of an older man,
tall, wearing a cloak.
What's not in here?
Uh...
Grey cloak, grey green.
Dark boots.
I didn't get a good look.
Uh...
I heard his voice, I'd recognize it.
Here's what we'll do, Mr. Karn.
You'll stop filing requests for Andor.
Anticipating that,
I will inform the Bureau of Standards
that you were of service
to the Empire today.
I was a good deputy inspector!
I was very good.
I solved a double murder
and found the killer in two days.
I was overly ambitious, yes,
but time was slipping away,
and the opportunity was real.
Service to the Empire, you just said it.
Can one ever be too aggressive
in preserving order?
I didn't deserve what happened.
I wish you luck.
I'm running late.
It's clear you need Andor
in order to find his partner.
This is more important than the death
of two Corporate Security guards.
I could be a valuable asset going forward.
Raise the alarm one more time,
and it won't be me you're speaking to.
Forget this happened.
Stop right there.
On program.
That means, hands on head,
eyes front, feet on the floor.
Do it.
Zap rod.
If I have to use it, you'll remember it.
Yes? Yes?
What's goin' on? Where's your partner?
They had a tech problem on One.
Delivery takes priority
over tech, you know that.
He'll be here any second.
New man ready on five-two-D,
requesting units override.
<i>Copy that. Coming up.</i>
That's not good.
This was on the schedule.
- He can't just not turn up.
- He'll be here.
<i>Override engaged.
Five-two, you have the floor.</i>
We've got deliveries' waiting.
- Eyes front.
- Let's just get him out on the Ring.
Step forward, let's go, move.
Step forward and stop, now, move.
Stop.
Eyes front, I said.
Sorry, I had to wait.
They were short-handed.
They had to pull a guy out from Four.
I came as quick as I could.
Post up. We're already behind.
- We good?
- Yes, you can go.
- Ready on the floor?
- Looks good.
Prep for door.
<i>On program.</i>
Step on to the lift and stop.
- Move forward.
- New man on the floor!
- Move.
- Hold your positions.
Step on there and stop.
Step off, move.
I said, step off, now!
Move!
This is Unit Five-Two-D.
Level five, room two,
the D is for Day shift.
Seven levels of factory,
seven rooms per level,
seven tables per room,
seven men, each table.
My name is Kino Loy.
I'm the Five-Two-D unit manager.
The forty-nine men
in this room answer to me.
Name.
Keef.
Keef Girgo.
He won't be back.
They only come to pick up the dead
and bring their replacements.
You're mine now.
Off program!
Back to work!
Listen up.
It's a 12-hour shift.
Productivity is encouraged,
evaluation is constant.
You have been assigned table five,
which is the pod that is behind
because you're not on the line
doing your job.
- Can you read?
- Yeah.
You see in the main boxes,
one through seven,
those are the scores for the tables
in this room, on this shift.
What's your table number?
Five.
There you go, table five.
See it? At the bottom?
Last place. That's you.
The seven tallies are the running shift
totals of all the other rooms
on this floor.
You play against
all the other tables in this room,
I play against all the other rooms.
- Play?
- Call it what you will,
the point of this conversation is that
you understand one thing most clearly.
I have 249 days left of my sentence.
I have a free hand in how I run this room.
I'm used to being
in the top three on the level.
You will wanna keep that happening.
I'm sensing you understand me.
Sick, injured, you talk to me.
Problems with another inmate,
I'll know before you do.
Losing hope, your mind,
keep it to yourself.
Don't ever slow up my line.
Table five.
Table five!
Table five?
Yeah, we've been waiting.
What do we call you?
Keef.
I'm Jemboc. Welcome.
Xaul.
Taga.
Ulaf.
Ham.
And this is Melshi.
We're down ten.
- We're a man short, he'll give us a pass.
- He should.
- He won't.
- He's done it before.
- That was months ago.
- We're down ten. You're dreaming.
- He's done it before.
- We're wasting time.
Down 12 before you know it.
They give us a new man
with only an hour left?
Forty-two minutes,
come on, boys, we can rally.
- They're up there, laughing.
- Don't.
- Melshi's right.
- We're wasting time.
Jem thinks Kino's in charge.
Hey, new guy, prepare to fry.
- Keef.
- What?
It's his name. Right?
Keef.
Work!
- Ham's right, get to it.
- Fly.
Stand back.
Watch what I do, exactly what I do.
You'll be where I am this time tomorrow.
With seven men, I'm the Swing,
I'll be feeding the table
so it might be a little different...
- He's on the box.
- They're callin' him.
No.
<i>Five-Two-D shift
productivity levels are unacceptable.</i>
<i>We're calling a new clock.</i>
Okay, listen up!
This will be a sprint segment.
39 minutes on the tone.
<i>As ever, the least
productive table will be disciplined.</i>
- Hands away.
- Clear.
Come on, boys.
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on, come on.
Get busy, or get fried!
Keep it going!
Not for me.
I'll have hers.
You used to like it.
I was just better at pretending.
Well, that I find hard to believe.
<i>Sagrona.</i>
- What are we toasting?
- A quick night.
Hmm. I'll drink to that.
So, the evening's agenda?
I need votes to stall
the Emperor's latest overreach.
Hello, Tay.
Tay Kolma, how prompt you are.
Perrin.
Still in town, or commuting?
- Bit of both.
- Something to drink?
What are we having?
Taste of home, eh? I'll have one.
Make it three.
I'm fine, thank you.
- Mon is working.
- Well, there's much to be done.
I don't think
you're on the menu tonight, Tay.
The Senator is pitching politics,
not charity.
Saving the Empire from the Emperor.
Do you remember Perrin at 15?
Oh, let's not.
The academy firebrand.
- Two squigs again, sir?
- Please.
How things change, eh?
The new legislation
is definitely having an effect.
The rebels might have thought that over
before blowing up Aldhani.
Thank you.
<i>Sagrona.</i>
<i>Sagrona teema.</i>
Well, good luck, feeding
the galaxy. I'm off to feed myself.
Charity begins at home.
I was hoping you'd come.
I wish I had better news.
I'm about to get very busy.
The new banking regulations
are making life difficult.
- Difficult or impossible?
- I don't know.
They're staffing up Imperial auditors,
we'll see where they are placed.
Is there anything we can do?
That has its own risks.
Leida.
- Uh, we've met.
- Indeed.
You're here all the time now.
Learning to love Coruscant.
Your father's looking for you.
You're drinking squigs?
No, I've lost my taste for it.
It's disgusting.
That's the point.
I should find Dad.
Nice to see you again.
What about the money I've moved already?
Not everything's tucked away.
We'll find a way to explain it.
So, we've given up on hiding it?
How much are we worrying about?
Four hundred thousand.
Senator.
Hi! I was just coming to get you.
Perrin said you were hoarding the squigs.
I always forget
you're Chandrilan at heart.
And I always forget how sweet you are
when you're looking for votes.
Keep it down!
Keep it down!
Line up!
Let's go!
Palpatine's frustrating,
yes, we agree.
Too easily provoked? Yes.
Overreactive, but...
Understatement.
Says what he means.
We're discussing legislation,
not speeches.
What does he mean?
What is public order?
It's an awfully big box, isn't it?
The Emperor's primary charge
is to protect us, is it not?
And that's what the P.O.R.D.
legislation will do.
How much protection is enough?
We know what too little looks like.
Surveillance and prosecution
without limit.
If you're doing nothing wrong,
what is there to fear?
I'm fearing your definition of wrong.
These are dangerous times.
- Dangerous times?
- Are they not?
Do you feel under threat?
Personally? Here, yes.
I'm at great risk of ingesting too much
of this nourishing Chandrilan hospitality.
This is our block.
You see the white lights?
That's the floor.
White is cold, red is hot.
The white lights start flashing,
you got seven seconds to get to your cell.
Sensors in the floor, two men in one cell,
it's an instant fry.
Fall out!
Fall out, fall out, fall out.
- Jem, walk the new man.
- Yeah.
Okay, Kino.
Come on.
This is you.
Your rack.
Everything you need here is on the wall.
Water, night light, toilet flips down,
got a plate, spoon, and shaver.
And food?
The tube.
You can get as much as you want.
They like us healthy and fueled.
Don't worry, you'll learn to eat it.
Tough way to start,
getting fried twice in one day.
But perhaps in a few shifts,
we can pull a winner.
Winner gets taste with their food.
Top table wins flavor.
Last place gets fried.
Right, this will be cleaned every day,
and that is your tab.
What did you do?
Nothing.
Lot of that lately.
At least you know where you stand
from the start, no surprises.
Ask him already.
They doubled everyone's number last month.
P-O-R-D.
- People must be talkin' about it.
- About what?
The Public Order
Resentencing Directive.
It's been a tough month here
waiting for news.
Can't help but wonder
what people are saying.
He's never heard of it.
- He never heard of it.
- Told you.
The Public Order Decree.
The resentencings.
- I'm sorry.
- All the rebel activity.
- It's rebel nonsense.
- I don't know anything about it.
- They slaughtered a garrison.
- That's not what he said.
- They burned it down.
- Does it matter?
We're the ones getting punished.
But this guy never heard of it.
Don't ever look at the number.
- Double, triple, it doesn't matter.
- Hey!
You're here 'til they don't want you.
Understand?
Enough! Melshi!
Getting out now is just a dream.
Those days are over.
I said, that's enough.
<i>Return to
your cells immediately.</i>
<i>Thirty seconds on red floor.</i>
You don't walk in your sleep, do you?
What?
You'll find out.
Tighten up!
Hot floor!
Oh, you should ask my wife.
I never look out the window.
Ah! Here she is.
Your embassy hostess.
The question was,
how many hours a day
do we stand here admiring the view?
We should. I know.
Not enough!
I think I'd never leave.
Well, that's always the way, isn't it?
One forgets to savor the familiar.
So true.
We came here as children.
- To visit?
- No, Mon became a Senator at 16.
So this is where you met?
No, we'd already been married a year.
That's so romantic.
And traditional.
The old ways of Chandrila.
As was the custom.
To each people its own.
Speaking of, have you seen Tay?
No, he left.
He said he had an early morning.
Well, of course.
Excuse me if you will.
So nice to meet you.
I'm going to spend more time
at this window, I promise you.
Tighten up!
Flight.
Three's off two, they're at 18.
Four is struggling.
Flight.
Hands away.
- Clear.
- Clear.
Away!
- Flight!
- Clear!
All right, come on, come on, come on.
Ready?
- I think so.
- It's tight.
Flip it.
- Ready up?
- Ready up.
Well, hang on, hang on.
- You okay?
- Pin jam.
Xaul, help him.
Yeah. Come on, mate.
Hey!
You just takin' a breather?
Come on, guys!
You got a chance of winning
the shift today!
Be a shame to waste it.
Keef.
Keef!
- Yeah.
- Yes!
Drill in!
It's not complaining
if you tell me what's going on.
Oh, you're freezing!
My mother was a whiner
and that'll cure you.
I'm just trying to figure out
if you need a doctor or not.
She has p-p-pain in the knee.
The doctor was here yesterday.
Your breathing sounds weak.
You got dizzy again.
What have you done now?
Apparently I'm throwing a party.
I heard the boys
had to carry you back here.
Oh! Word travels fast.
She fell.
<i>What was she doing by the hotel?</i>
She's obsessed with Troopers.
She fell trying to pry open
the old Rix flood gate.
- She gonna flush them out?
- No.
She wanted to see if the tunnel
under the hotel was still open.
Why?
So the Rebellion can sneak in
and take them by surprise.
She's a Rebel.
I should be coming by more often.
She's not your mother.
Or yours.
- She can't stay here much longer.
- Good luck with that.
What about the Daughters of Ferrix?
She's a past president.
They must have a warm room somewhere.
They've tried.
She's made her wishes clear.
Cassian.
You really don't know where he is?
Where did you go?
Who's the big one?
I've no idea.
Where were you?
I was about to come lookin'.
Cold now.
What?
There's a room to rent around the corner.
They have a sign up.
Can't just stay here.
I can.
Alone?
Two of us would draw too much attention.
You'll stay here and wait?
Just hope he shows up?
- Could be anywhere.
- This is all we have.
What's the alternative?
Haven't we been apart long enough?
It's not about us.
After what we've been through?
You think the Empire
stops to catch its breath?
This is a fight to the death, Vel.
Who would you say you are?
Maybe I'm a rich girl
running away from her family.
Well, that's cold.
Even for you.
I told you upfront
the struggle will always come first.
We take what's left.
I'm a mirror, Vel.
You love me because I show you
what you need to see.
Thank you.
Sure.
Well, I'll keep an eye.
Paak?
Are you as slow as I am?
Yeah, losing the hotel
is not good for business.
We need a meeting.
There's gotta be something we can do.
- What's up?
- I need to look for something in the back.
Not sure that's a good idea.
- It's been off for a while.
- It's urgent.
All right.
Kleya?
Kleya?
It's the shop owner on Ferrix.
She's trying to find Cassian Andor.
His mother is ill.
We're not answering. We can't.
She could show the right direction.
She's asking us.
She knows more than we do.
So much more.
She might have a lead.
More likely
it's the ISB working her radio.
- You're guessing!
- And you're slipping!
We're shutting down Ferrix.
The code, the frequency, all of it.
I'm thinking clearly and you're not.
Tell me to shut it down.
It's Andor.
Knowing he's out there, knowing me,
not knowing what he knows.
I took him on the Fondor.
Was I insane?
You were desperate
for Aldhani to work and it did.
And we'll find him, just not like this.
Vel was out hunting.
She and Cinta.
- Are they in Ferrix yet?
- I'll have a listen.
We're being extremely careful with it.
The woman's name is Bix Caleen.
Vel could have a look if it's safe.
They know what they're doing.
I'm not slipping, Kleya.
I've just been hiding for too long.
It's all different now.
We're going loud.
Vulnerability is inevitable.
I'm not slipping.
I know.
I just need you to wake up.
There's a lot to do.
Shut it down.
Coordinate alternatives for Segra Milo.
<i>Calculating.</i>
<i>Four potential routes.</i>
Let's take the long way around.
<i>Re-routing Segra Milo.</i>
No, no, no, no!
Aw, man.
- Who is it now?
- No!
He railed it!
- Who?
- Veemoss!
Veemoss!
Table three, the tall one.
He fell! Or jumped!
Aw, man, well,
we'll be smellin' him all night.
Here? He rails it here?
He was slipping. You could see it.
I don't care, man.
You rail here at night, I got no sympathy.
Shut up about it.
You'll be shorthanded
all day tomorrow.
Think about that
when you're gettin' fried.
Enough! Let's quiet down!
<i>Level five, grid disruption.</i>
<i>You have ten seconds
to get to your sleeping platforms.</i>
Move, move, move!
What's going on?
It's Paak's yard.
I'm not sure. They're all over it.
Detained for what?
Why won't you tell me?
Where are they taking my father?
Tell me! Where is he?
Where is my father?
- Shut him up!
- Silence!
- What's going on?
- They took Paak in last night.
- Where?
- The hotel. He never came home.
Get these people back. I want a perimeter.
Two and two, up and down, clear the lane!
Yes, sir!
- Let's go!
- You okay?
- I don't know.
- Move it.
Let's go, let's go!
Get out of the way!
Move it!
Caleen!
Bix Caleen!
That's your name, isn't it?
If not, the resemblance is quite striking.
Get to Zorby's. Run!
Get her!
- Move! Move! Move!
- Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.
Go!
Get her!
So, my friend,
the garrison at Aldhani, was that you?
I was just about to ask you
the same thing.
You'd never tell me if it was.
Somebody's sitting on some dosh.
If it's you,
I'm hoping you'll put it to good use.
Would I be out here in the cold
if I had just pinched
a 100 million credits?
That's exactly what you'd do.
And that's exactly
what I would say if I were you.
If you're trying to convince me
it was you, it's working.
Let's agree.
- It was a masterpiece.
- Well, now I'm sure.
Aren't you tired of playing
behind the scenes, Luthen?
Aren't you tired of fighting
with people who agree with you?
You come all this way to scold me?
Or did you bring me some toys?
Hmm.
I did, but they're not for free.
Nothing with you is free.
Not every operation is as flush as yours.
Tell me what you've got.
Well, how about a full set
of Imperial drive adapters?
I've also got three sealed
Steergard targeting deflectors.
Mmm.
You have this all here with you?
At what cost?
Anto Kreegyr.
- I want you to meet him.
- Anto Kreegyr?
He's been probing
the Imperial power station at Spellhaus.
He's found a weakness in the defenses.
It may take some time to work up,
but he's got an angle.
The man's an ox!
Slow! And stupid!
And strong.
I want you to hear his plan.
He'll need air support.
Let's just keep this simple.
I'll take all three deflectors. How much?
Well, you meet with Kreegyr, they're free.
- You don't, I won't sell.
- I work alone.
That's what I'm trying to change.
I'm not gonna put my people
at risk for someone else.
We need to pull together, Saw!
Whatever our final version
of success looks like,
there's no chance any of us
can make it real on our own.
We need the Empire to help.
We need them angry.
We need them coming down hard.
Oppression breeds rebellion.
Kreegyr needs air support.
- I'm not for hire.
- Think of it.
Think of Spellhaus in flames.
Neither of you could do it on your own,
but together...
Kreegyr's a separatist.
Maya Pei's a neo-Republican.
The Ghorman front.
The Partisan alliance?
Sectorists.
Human cultists?
Galaxy partitionists.
They're lost!
All of them, lost!
Lost!
What are you, Luthen?
I've never really known.
What are you?
I'm a coward.
I'm a man who's terrified
the Empire's power
will grow beyond the point
where we can do anything to stop it.
I'm the one who says,
"We'll die with nothing if we don't put
aside our petty differences."
Petty?
I am the only one with clarity of purpose.
Well, anarchy is a seductive concept.
A bit of a luxury I'd argue
to a man who is hiding in cold caves,
and begging for spare parts.
No sale today, Luthen.
Good luck with Anto Kreegyr.
She's on her way up.
Would you like us to clear the room?
No.
I want her to see him.
What are you doing?
Get him out of here.
- Quickly.
- You two, with me.
Now!
Paak.
Paak. Hey.
Hello, Bix.
- Let's go!
- Come on, come on!
Hands away!
Clear!
Good?
All right.
Okay, ready?
- Bring it. Bring it in.
- Come on, boys, yes.
It's good, it's good.

Six years.
- No, no, wait!
- Take him.
Change of guidelines.
- I didn't do anything! Hey!
- Take it up with the Emperor.
I'm just a tourist!

Get straight with that? Your worries...
That's enough.
You have engaged the curiosity of the ISB.

One would be wrong.

shorthanded all day tomorrow.
Think about that
when you're gettin' fried.
Hello, Bix.
I don't like wasting time.
But one must be careful.
You pull in the net and the easy thing,
the quick thing,
is to assume that everything
you've dragged to shore is a fish.
I have colleagues who believe
that's the prudent mindset
in defense of the Empire.
But I take a more nuanced view.
I try.
So here's what we'll do, Bix.
I'll tell you everything I know,
and in doing so, perhaps convince you
to cooperate without intervention.
Failing that,
we have Dr. Gorst,
who's developed a unique interview system
some of us are very excited about.
As you now know,
we brought in Salman Paak last night.
We tracked him
to a radio hidden in his yard
and thought he might cooperate
without encouragement.
For a man with very little actual
rebellious activity on his resume,
he was remarkably resistant,
which of course just makes us think
there's more to be learned.
Which leads to a longer session.
And suddenly, it's morning.
And there we are, wasting time.
In the end,
it was a very poor decision on his part.
We learned everything we needed to know,
and quite frankly,
it hardly seems worth the price he's paid.
Paak attended a separatist meeting
two years ago in Jondora
where he met a woman who said
that if he was serious about politics,
he might like to act as liaison
for Ferrix when he returned home.
He was sent the fractal radio unit
you used yesterday afternoon.
Now this unknown woman
who recruited him to the cause
seemed less interested
in generating political activity on Ferrix
than she was in using
your planet's unique commercial position
to acquire stolen Imperial equipment.
Did you know Salman Paak
was paid to keep that radio alive?
Did you know
you were the only one to use it?
Were you aware that the buyer,
your contact,
met Paak only once
before being turned over to you?
You're in my net, Bix.
Are you a fish or are you a thief, hmm?
Seems a shame
to end up on the carving board
if your motivation here is just money.
You have no recorded history
of political troublemaking.
You're a business owner.
Now, I would prefer a conversation
rather than put Dr. Gorst back to work.
But that, for the moment,
is entirely up to you.
You're ISB, aren't you?
Worst of the worst.
You're going to tell me absolutely
everything you know about the buyer.
You seem to enjoy this.
You're going to tell me all about
Cassian Andor and their relationship.
They don't have a relationship.
You will be giving me a full,
detailed accounting of every single piece
of stolen Imperial equipment
you've passed along,
where it came from,
who was bribed along the way,
and where it has gone.
I don't know the buyer.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, Salman Paak says you've had
at least six meetings he's aware of.
He says you sit up on that radio
for hours at a time.
I signal.
Sometimes he answers,
he comes, he buys, he leaves.
Six face to face meetings.
He and Andor, blowing up buildings
and killing security guards.
You're injured trying to warn them.
Your coworker is killed
trying to win your freedom.
Andor and the buyer escape together.
It sounds to me
like a nest of relationships.
When was the last time
you spoke with Cassian Andor?
The very worst thing
you can do right now is bore me.
You're not gonna
believe me anyway, are you?
No.
I suppose not.
- She's all yours, Dr. Gorst.
- Thank you.
Turn.
Ready?
Your side. Fly.
Table three.
They won't be shorthanded all day.
There's a new man coming down.
But we can take the shift if we push.
- We're already up on Four.
- I could use a proper meal.
Two, that's a threat.
Ulaf?
- What do you say, old timer?
- Short timer.
Make a run for the win?
My hand. I might need some help.
- Let's switch.
- What?
- Come on.
- He's right. Switch.
- Why?
- Keef is faster.
- There's a better way of saying that.
- The hand.
- What's all this?
- Just a little rebalancing.
- And...
- Ulaf, what do you owe?
Be 41 shifts tomorrow.
You are the next man out.
You are the shortest of the short.
This swap your idea?
Me? No, no. It's Taga.
Are you kiddin'?
- Turn.
- Wise move.
Ulaf is going home.
New man for them today?
Always the next day, right?
You know the drill.
Oh, the...
The restraints are nothing to be feared.
It's much safer
for you to be tethered as we engage.
There's nothing intrinsically physical
about this process,
but we've had some early trials
that were a bit chaotic.
There's an Outer Rim moon
called Dizon Fray.
There was a sentient species there,
quite unusual.
Extremely hostile to the concept
of an Imperial refueling center
that was being planned.
I say "was"
because they created such a stir
that the local commanders were granted
permission to use any means necessary.
And, um, well, what's important
for our purposes here today
is that the massacre of the Dizonites
was broadcast and recorded
as proof of mission.
They make a sound as they die.
A sort of choral, agonized pleading.
It was quite unlike anything
anyone has ever heard before.
There were three communications officers
monitoring the documentation,
and they were found
hours later huddled together
in various states of emotional distress,
in a crawl space
beneath the ship's bridge.
We've taken the recordings
and modified them slightly,
layering, adjusting.
And we found a section
of what we believe are primarily children,
which has its own particular effect.
Doesn't take long.
It won't feel that way to you inside.
But, um...
Let me know
when you're willing to cooperate.
Oh, and if you're having
difficulty speaking,
just shake your head from side to side.
You'll want to be sure of that, Bix,
that you're cooperating fully.
It's repeat listenings
that cause the most damage.
Are we ready?
Let's get on with it.
Drill away.
I'm taking my run.
<i>On program.</i>
<i>New man on the floor.</i>
<i>Everyone, hold positions.</i>
New man on the floor!
Hold your positions!
Step on to the lift and stop.
Two men back. Two weapons.
- Move forward.
- No boots.
...on that lift.
Silence!
He's touching the rail.
Believe me now?
- The elevator's not wired.
- Up!
Nothing that moves can fry you.
I have a new idea.
Don't wait.
We attack while they're coming down. Now.
- They'll just go back up.
- No.
We make it stop.
We shut it down half way.
Take one guard, one weapon.
This is Unit Five-Two-D.
Level five, room two.
The "D" is for Day-shift.
The 49 men in this room answer to me.
Don't put them away.
Shall we begin?
When was the last time
you spoke with Cassian Andor?
- Let me. Let me, let me.
- I can do it.
- I know.
- Ready up.
I'm ready.
Ready now.
Where do we stand?
Are we in the game?
We're up a rack with an hour left.
What? What's on now?
We just talked about this.
We told you two minutes ago.
Do you think I don't wanna win?
Am I working or not?
One rack up. Ours to lose.
- Turn.
- What are you waiting for?
Keep her here.
Keep her alive.
As a hostage?
She's a witness.
She's the only one
we've got who can identify Axis.
- And Salman Paak?
- I don't care.
I'd like to hang him.
What's left of him anyway.
Make sure they know who's in charge.
As you wish.
The senator from Chandrila
stands with those in opposition
to the Emperor's new
public safety legislation.
Long live the Empire!
Is there a more important issue facing
this body right now
than Imperial overreach?
The Public Order Resentencing Directive
is the next step
on an all too predictable march
toward complete unchallenged authority.
She speaks the truth!
- Boo!
- Keep it down!
Our first responsibility
is to the citizens who have sent us here.
Our second vow is to protect the power
and independence
of this remarkable chamber.
Listen to her!
I stand here today to speak with
senators who've come with open minds,
those of you who still believe
that when we enter this building
we are in a temple.
<i>Drive.</i>
They called from the residence.
Your cousin, she's arrived.
<i>What?</i>
Your cousin.
<i>At the embassy?</i>
<i>She's there now?</i>
Well, they said you'd want to know.
- Where are they coming from?
- Don't know.
Keep it down!
They could keep us here forever
if they wanted.
That's enough from you, Melshi.
Right, everybody settles down right now.
Something's wrong.
Whatever it is,
they're taking their time about it.
What's going on?
What are they saying?
I think it's level two.
- All right.
- It gets stale in here.
Can't be much longer.
You all right, Ulaf?
I'm fine.
Level two, far side.
Taga, something broken?
What's he saying?
Level two.
He's coming this way around now.
- What's he saying?
- Quiet!
What's goin' on?
What was that?
What is that?
It's nothing. Someone didn't load in.
They are counting.
So they cut the power?
What do you think's happening?
Something's wrong on two.
- They're going too fast. I can't read it.
- Everybody, calm down!
Something's really wrong on two.
Look at me.
You haven't got a clue
what they are saying.
"Level two, far side. Level two."
Are you all scrambled or something?
It takes a week for one word
to get all the way up here.
And you're panicking about something
that's happening
on the other side of the building!
How many hands does it take
for one word to get through up here?
It's a long way, yes.
But you've got to admit...
<i>Stand in place.</i>
<i>On program. Feet down.
Face front. Hands on heads.</i>
<i>We will have immediate facility compliance</i>
<i>or we will begin activating
floors without warning.</i>
<i>Bridges on program
will have their doors opened.</i>
<i>All shifts to proceed
immediately to their stations.</i>
It's amazing.
Aunt Vel's been to Tassio Moon,
look what she brought me.
Your father may have an opinion.
We'll see if he lets you wear it.
He lets me do anything I want.
Well, why don't you go try it on?
Where have you been?
- Traveling.
- Six months?
There's a lot to see.
I don't have enough to worry about.
Look at you.
The Empire doesn't rest, Mon.
The Rebellion comes first.
We take what's left.
Tell me you're going home for a visit.
They've been after me to find you.
Of course.
Just came through to see you first
and get cleaned up a bit.
Seriously, Vel,
what does he have you doing?
Who?
You're one to worry about.
Trapped here, boxed in.
- Please tell me you're being careful.
- Things are happening.
There's risk.
There's no other way.
I'm starting to think
we're in over our heads.
- He's got us spinning...
- Stop.
You took a vow.
It fits.
You never think about escaping?
You know I won't answer that.
I'll take that as a no.
Take what you like.
You flap that mouth of yours any longer,
you'll regret it.
I'm sure you've thought about it.
How many guards on each level?
You want out of here alive,
turn that part of your mind off.
Okay.
How many shifts you have left?
217.
So, tell me what you know before you go.
You've been warned.
You think they care what we say?
You're on your own with this.
Why?
You think they're listening?
You think they care enough
to make an effort?
Like you would know.
I know this.
They don't need to care.
All they need to do
is turn this floor on twice a day
and keep their numbers rolling.
Why bother listening to us?
We are nothing to them.
Melshi's right.
We're cheaper than droids
and easier to replace.
Good luck to you.
You think they care what we say?
Nobody's listening.
Nobody.
How many guards are on each level?
Nobody's listening.
Nobody's listening!
You took Gorst.
Good to see that's working out.
Yes, sir.
The interrogation was thorough.
We've no reason to believe
anything was withheld.
But no ID on your Axis.
He's still just 'The Buyer'?
It's disappointing, I know.
But it does suggest
the scope of what he's doing.
Axis obviously runs
a very disciplined operation.
And one that's large enough to not be
reliant on any one network or supplier.
Caleen gave us a list of every piece
of gear that came through Ferrix.
And we think we've already got a match
to a targeting unit recovered
from a safe house
operated by a rebel cell
associated with Maya Pei.
Andor, he's all the way through this.
Yes, and that's what
I'd like to highlight.
He's the local thief, right?
The runaway murderer?
Andor returned to Ferrix three nights
after Aldhani with money in his pocket.
Couldn't that be
from the sale of the Starpath?
Can't be. They left it behind, right?
You're trying to connect Aldhani?
That's a bit of a stretch.
He was clean-shaven.
Andor had shaved.
Question, "Describe his appearance."
Answer, "He'd shaved his beard."
The rebels at Aldhani were clean-shaven.
Two soldiers from the garrison
who got a look at him
felt some similarity
to our reference picture.
Well, that's worth running down.
An Aldhani connection
would certainly amplify interest.
Let's follow that up.
You didn't question the mother?
I decided to wait.
Better now leaving her in place
and standing back.
She's too old and frail
for anything serious,
and if nothing else, she's our bait.
She's the reason Andor came back.
Perhaps they communicate.
If they are, we'll know.
We're on her full-time.
Did you hear it?
- Have you heard?
- What?
What happened to unit two-five.
- We weren't told anything.
- You're kidding.
They don't know about it.
They were fried out!
- They're killed. They're all gone.
- Who said?
- Both shifts.
- A hundred men.
That can't be right.
You've heard nothing.
What did he say?
- I don't know.
- They're all dead.
Who's saying this?
- Maintenance tech.
- We had a team go down.
- They said they fried the whole bridge.
- Speak up.
He told Zinska.
Why?
Ask him.
That's incredible.
Zinska?
He heard they were making trouble.
<i>On program. Feet down.</i>
<i>We will have immediate facility compliance
or we will begin...</i>
What did he say?
What happened on two?
We... We don't know.
They set 'em all free.
- Get on program!
- Kino! Kino!
We need to be careful.
The less they think we know, the better.
Hold your program!
Tighten up and listen!
It's a rumor.
Maybe it's true.
Maybe it's not.
We have heard nothing.
It's just another day, another shift.
So let's keep our mouths shut,
keep our heads down
until we know what's going on.
You're up early.
Home late, up early.
Dressed and groomed.
Trimmed your hair.
Hmm. Something I should know?
I told you not to leave
dinner out last night.
Your message was so brief.
One worries.
You're so busy these days,
perhaps you're forgetting to eat.
You've been searching my room again.
It's called cleaning.
I like a tidy house.
You've been in my private box.
I have ways of knowing.
I find you a job, I press your uniform,
I prepare two meals a day,
I move mountains
to scrape you off the floor
and put you back on your feet,
and what do I reap?
What is the return on my investment?
We were talking about you snooping on me.
The shadow of a son, a tenant, a stranger.
That's new. You'll wanna remember that.
All that time away on Morlana.
What if I'd let your neglect
drive me insane?
Imagine that.
Look back just months ago
when you could easily ignore me.
Imagine.
Imagine I'd cracked
under the weight of your neglect.
Imagine I'd cracked
and wasn't here now to pick up the pieces.
I've been promoted.
I knew they'd recognize your promise.
The demands of my time will be increased.
Uncle Harlo will be so pleased.
- Drill in.
- Right.
Ulaf, come on, mate.
Pull away.
- Come on, boys. Let's go.
- One, two.
- Let's go.
- I'm there. I'm there. I got it.
That's it. That's it.
- All right.
- Okay, let's go.
Come on, Ulaf.
Hands away.
- Clear.
- Ulaf, hands.
Turn.
Come on, boys. We can do this.
I'll do it. Just... Just get it in.
Come on, boys.
Just the one night, Vel?
I'm afraid so.
Heading back to Chandrila today?
Yes. The Pilgrimage.
Find yourself a husband?
Wasn't on my list of things to do.
Well, you need a widower at this point.
Who's left of any value at your age?
Yes. All the good ones are taken.
We've had an influx
of Chandrilans here recently.
- You remember Tay Kolma?
- I do.
Mother's old boyfriend.
What?
Is that something you've told her?
The key word is "old," darling.
We were in grade school together.
At least you've not gone political, Vel.
All the interesting people
are getting very tedious these days.
No one ever calls me tedious.
<i>Tay Kolma?</i>
Money.
Is that all it is?
I don't have enough to worry about?
Anything I can do?
Yes.
Be a spoiled, rich girl for a while.
Remind people that's who you are.
I'll try.
What have we done, Vel?
We've chosen a side.
We're fighting against the dark.
We're making something of our lives.
- Syril Karn.
- I know who you are.
- What are you doing here?
- I...
I wanted to thank you for the promotion.
I had nothing to do with it.
Well, my boss seems
to think that you did.
We simply gave you a clean bill of health.
Have you been waiting out here?
Yes.
I'd never lie to you.
I...
I needed to find you
and it's not that easy
to thank you for what you did
and what you're doing.
And to follow on and...
Try to follow on the conversation
we had last month.
That wasn't a conversation.
You were brought in for questioning.
Are you stalking me?
I know you work here and I come
sometimes to see if I'll see you.
I am an ISB supervisor.
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in right now?
I thought I had ruined my life.
I thought I was done.
After meeting you and discovering,
you understood how dangerous
Cassian Andor was. Just...
Just being in your presence, I...
I've realized that life is worth living.
I realized that if nothing else,
there was justice,
and beauty in the galaxy
and if I just kept going...
Perhaps my deranged belief that there
was something better fated for me
in the future was a dream
worth clinging to.
I could have you arrested,
you are aware of that?
I want what you want.
I sense it. I know it.
You're out of your mind.
I have already given you a second chance.
You come near me again,
you pursue any of this,
and I swear
I'll have you in a cage on the Outer Rim.
There you are. Just came in.
They picked up a rebel pilot an hour ago.
- From our target list?
- No, random.
But he's using
a stolen Imperial masking unit.
- One of ours?
- Well, Corv is checking but...
- Where are they holding him?
- A destroyer off Steergaard.
Get Dr. Gorst,
send him out there immediately.
I already did.
He's own his way.
- Do you want to go?
- Yes. No. There's no time.
I'll interrogate remotely.
Good work.
Go.
I've been over the accounts.
I wish you'd called me sooner.
There were better ways to do this.
It was so easy at the beginning.
If we plan
on making any further donations,
we need to be sure
that the work you've done so far
- isn't gonna come back to haunt you.
- They can't all be hidden?
There's a 400,000 credit withdrawal
that's proving a bit of a problem.
It appears on the ledger,
then it vanishes.
- It needs to be papered over.
- How?
Easiest thing would be a deposit.
If I had that much sitting around,
I wouldn't have burdened you.
How much trouble am I in?
There's no trouble at all
unless they scan the accounts.
But that's coming.
Time is not unlimited.
I need a loan.
A certain kind of loan.
You seem to have thought this through.
We need a Chandrilan banker
with treasury relationships,
and a book of business
that's incomprehensibly huge.
You have someone in mind.
It's not a long list.
- And yet you're afraid to say who it is.
- Davo Sculdun.
He is not a banker.
- He's a thug.
- The wealthiest thug of them all.
Don't tell me
you've spoken to him already.
- I wanted to bring you a solution.
- Have you told him?
That you're feeling constricted
by the new tax laws.
- It's common enough.
- A senator, 400,000 missing.
What will he think?
He'll think you're just like
everyone else he works with.
You want what's yours.
At what cost?
I'm not sure.
He wants to meet you.
He wants to meet here.
Davo Sculdun, here. You must be joking.
I pushed back but...
I could keep looking.
It was a routine customs check.
- Totally random.
- Just the pilot?
- He was the only one on board.
- And no witnesses.
The beauty of it, sir.
He flashed an Imperial profile
for a moment then vanished.
They thought it was odd and pursued.
Any chance he radioed home
before they got him?
He swears he didn't.
He thought he'd get away.
This was a Dr. Gorst interview?
Yes, sir. Confidence is high.
He got the pilot
talking almost immediately.
The Imperial masking device
he used is one of the items stolen
- from the naval yard in Lozash last year.
- Incredible.
Apologies. We were offsite.
We've got a rebel pilot in custody.
One of Anto Kreegyr's group.
He was picked up at a customs check.
We don't think Kreegyr knows
he's gone missing yet.
He's telling us there's a raid planned
on the power station at Spellhaus.
Where was he heading?
- On his way to Kafrene.
- They'll count him missing soon.
Exactly. We don't want
Kreegyr getting spooked.
We can't hang on to him.
We can't let him go.
Destroy the ship.
Make it look like an accident.
There's too much at stake.
If I were Kreegyr, I'd be suspicious.
We want Kreegyr moving forward.
What if we foul the ship?
An accident. Something mechanical.
Have the pilot found dead in the cockpit.
What would happen?
They'd have to find it.
But they'd tow it into Kafrene.
If we did it quickly, staged it properly,
let it drift into traffic.
Make it so. Top priority.
Quickly and carefully.
We leave no trace.
Excellent work.
I want a meeting with military
intelligence immediately about Spellhaus.
Let's go.
<i>Inmates, on program.</i>
<i>Program in place.</i>
<i>Low yield tables in position.</i>
Table two takes the shift
by six racks and three.
Table one in the box.
- Ulaf.
- Come on. Let's get this done.
- Can he stand?
- Yeah.
<i>On program.</i>
Cover him. Cover him. Cover him.
- Hang on.
<i>- Inmates on program.</i>
<i>Program in place.</i>
<i>Low yield tables in position.</i>
Ulaf. Hey, look at me.
Okay.
Almost there. Almost there.
Kino, he needs a doctor.
Get him to the cell.
We're late. Come on. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Keep moving.
One, two, three.
All right. All right.
- Take his head.
- I got you.
Zinska, tell 'em we need
a med tech-up here.
You, get going. Now.
Hang in there, Ulaf.
You've only got a few shifts left.
Then you're going home.
<i>On program.</i>
Step off. Let's go.
Here he comes, Uli.
He'll have you back in your cell
soon enough.
Haven't seen you for a while.
I haven't gone anywhere.
His name's Ulaf.
I've seen him before.
Hold that.
He's only got 40 shifts left.
Just wanna get him up and about.
He's tough as an old rock.
Look at me, brother.
His name is Ulaf.
I don't wanna know his name.
He's got 40 shifts left.
So we just want something
to get him through the next few days.
Get him back on his feet.
That's not an option.
What?
What, you can't save him?
There's nothing to save.
He's had a massive stroke.
What are you doing?
I can't help him.
I can't help anyone.
I need a bag and a trolley.
It's coming.
He's lucky.
He'll pass peacefully, which is more
than I can say for the rest of us.
Another week like this, and you'll
be begging for what he's getting.
What do you mean?
You heard me.
Hold his shoulders. You, hold his legs.
What happened on level two?
You'll want to keep your men in line.
Now hold him.
He'll feel nothing.
He's passed.
What do you mean...
keep my men in line?
What happened down on two?
We need a bag and a trolley.
I said it's coming.
They made a mistake.
A man who was just released on four
ended up back on two the next day.
Word got out on the floor,
and then they killed them all.
You need those other men there?
They're just leaving.
Now.
If he was released...
You heard me.
No one's getting out, are they?
Not now.

I had no idea it was that much.
It was so easy. I did it myself.
Set up a stream of accounts.
It was like water running downhill.
I'd empty the bottom,

(SIGHS)
MON: A few months ago, I was contacted
by one of the bankers back home,
I was warned that Imperial inspectors
might be taking a close look
at Chandrilan accounts.
He said they were contacting clients
to make sure everything was in order.
I did what I could.
I pulled everything I could access
up the hill into the main account.
There was one empty ledger at the end
of the line that was off-balance.
But it was so obscure
and I just didn't know what else to do.
I was nervous.
I went to Luthen. I told him

Tell Kreegyr I'm in.
Tell him I'll bring air power,
but we take tactical orders from no one.
You've taken a long time
coming back to me, Saw.
We get to loot the eastern garrison.
Whatever we can carry off.
And I want all the gear that you promised.
You're too late. He's going tomorrow.
We'll be ready. We have charts.
All he has to do
is tell us when he wants it,
and agree to my terms. Make it happen.
I think not.
Why?
You were so eager for it.
ISB knows Kreegyr's plan.
They'll be waiting for him.
And how do we know this?
I won't tell you that.
And Kreegyr, he doesn't know.
- How do you know I won't tell him?
- I don't.
I don't know what you'll do.
(SCOFFS)
It's far from ideal for either of us.
You're willing to burn him.
You're the random factor.
- It's 30 men.

SAW: So, you know he's doomed.
Which means either you're ISB
or you have someone inside
that you are protecting.
Or I'm just a very good listener.
You think it's worth losing Kreegyr?
I did. I'm not sure right now.
What if it was me instead of Kreegyr?
What would you do?
Kreegyr doesn't know me.
I'm not vulnerable if he's captured.
- Surely you've met him.
- LUTHEN: I've met him.
I've been in a room with him,
but he doesn't know that.
We send people. We drop supplies.
We have special radios. He can't hurt me.
Like I can.
It's your decision, Saw.
It's your decision.
But know the choice.
Do we let Kreegyr
go down and play the long game,
or do we warn him and throw away a source
that's taken years to cultivate?
You have people everywhere, don't you?
- You're avoiding the question.
- SAW: All of your sources...
Try to concentrate.
There's someone with Kreegyr?
Someone at ISB?
Maybe there's someone here with me.
- You're wasting time.
- Why wouldn't you?
- You're avoiding the choice.
- Who is it? Who is it?
It's Tubes.
(TWO-TUBES SPEAKING TOGNATH)
He's my man.
He tells me everything.

- What is this?
What kind of game is this?
- (GRUNTS)
- Oh.
There's no way out alive.
Of that you must be sure.
I'm doing this so you'll listen.
So, listen.
Kreegyr goes down,
the ISB will feel invincible.
They'll feel untouchable.
We'll have a clear field to play.
The alternative...
Kreegyr pulls out, we wave him off.
They'll know they'll have to wonder.
They'll trust nothing.
Just like you're doing right now.
(INHALES)
If I were ISB, Saw,
why wouldn't I just send you out there
with him?
I didn't want you
to have to make this choice.

you spoke with Cassian Andor?
<i>Ferrix has been
hiding long enough.</i>
<i>So now
you're taking on the Empire?</i>
What's left to keep you here?
The Rebellion.
Did he tell you?
He's writin' a manifesto.
You're my ideal reader.
He said to give this to you.
So, searching for a more
fluid banking situation, are we?
What will it cost?
I have a 14-year-old son.
I'd like to bring him with me.
- I'm not asking for betrothal.
- Then what are we talking about?
<i>An introduction.</i>
<i>Your daughter's 13.
She'll soon come of age.</i>
Don't tell me you're taking proposals.
I'm in so much trouble, Vel.
ISB knows Kreegyr's plan.
They'll be waiting for him.
- You think it's worth losing Kreegyr?
- I did.
<i>Calling about Andor.</i>
<i>You wanted news if I had it.</i>
Yes. Please, go on.
<i>The mother.
She's passed away.</i>
<i>He might show up at the funeral.</i>
<i>- They just moved the body.</i>
- What happens now?
<i>As a prominent citizen of Ferrix,
she rates a big send-off.</i>
They'll want to close Rix Road.
You're going to give them a permit.
<i>Cass, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Your mother's dead.</i>
You're here.
Welcome. And just in time for dinner.
I'll eat later.
I want to get changed,
take a walk around the town.
I'll pull an escort.
No need.
Corv will take me.
Keep it small.
As you wish.
- Xan.
- Hey.
Looked like you were wrapping up,
so I thought I'd wait.
- How long you been here?
- I spoke to Cassian.
- What?
- He called the shop.
How?
Picked up the old box line
and there he was.
- Where?
- I don't know. I...
- Where is he?
- He wouldn't say.
Does he know about Maarva?
Yeah, he does now.
It was a very short conversation.
- He asked about the funeral.
- Let's walk.
- Who else knows this?
- No one.
Keep it that way.
Can't be too careful.
They're watching Maarva's.
Could be anywhere.
He'd be insane to come back now.
I hope you told him that.
Like I said, it was a very short call.
I can't stop thinkin' about
this whole Maarva situation.
Imagine losing you mother like this.
I couldn't stand it.
Not being there for your mom.
Have Brasso place her stone,
just breaks your heart, right?
You gotta feel for Cassian.
I'd be losing my mind.
Want another?
Maybe just one.
Why worry it though?
It's not like he knows about it.
Guarantee you,
he's got no idea what's going on.
Bank on that.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Hey.
You know something I don't?
Do me a favor, keep it that way.
Hey.
We'll have another round.
I thought you left without me.
- Crossed my mind.
- Mmm.
- I looked for you but, uh...
- I'm sure.
Kloris, we'd like privacy, please.
Ma'am.
What now?
You're gambling again.
- Nonsense.
- And here, in Coruscant.
That's ridiculous.
Do you have any idea
how tired of this I am?
<i>It's a lie.</i>
<i>It's total fantasy.
Who's telling you this?</i>
- Please.
- No, I'm serious.
Perrin, please.
- Who is saying this?
- Just don't.
We'll go back there, right now.
We'll put it to an end.
We will not.
I've been shamed enough for one night.
You can't live without a casino? Fine.
You go to Canto Bight
and do whatever it is you need to do.
But not here.
You promised.
- I've kept my promise!
- Keep your voice down.
<i>He can't hear me.</i>
<i>This is wrong, Mon.</i>
<i>This is people trying to take you down
by coming after me.</i>
You tell me who's saying this
and I'll tell you why.
Oh, please.
Where would I get the money?
That's the question
that scares me the most.
Someone's lying to you.
On that, we can agree.
You're here.
I couldn't remember
if I'd locked the door,
if you'd even remember how to get here.
- And here I am.
- I was on my way to pick you up.
This guy I've been watching, he's ISB.
He's their guy in town.
His boss showed up tonight.
Good to see you too.
An ISB supervisor came in tonight.
A woman.
Here. Now.
I was on my way to pick you up
when they left the hotel
dressed like locals.
I had to follow.
They're getting ready, Vel.
They must know Andor's coming.
You did the right thing.
We have to get there first.
- I know.
- Everything depends on it.
I said I know.
Come away from the window.
<i>Here's the thing, Cassian.</i>
<i>The man who sees everything
is more blessed than cursed.</i>
<i>Look at that. Here we go.</i>
Stand back, let it drip.
Look how quickly that's cleaned up.
Hard to believe, right?
Two minutes.
No longer, no shorter.
You know why
they don't make these anymore?
'Cause they'd rather sell you
a brand new system at ten times the price.
I mean, how many we got?
60? 70 of them?
Just sittin' there.
Five hundred credits each.
People don't look down
to where they should.
They don't look down,
they don't look past the rust.
<i>Not us though, eh?</i>
<i>Eyes open, possibilities everywhere.</i>
Just need to get this cleaned up
before Maarva find us
doing this in the house.
Who's there?
- Cass?
- Pegla?
Down, now!
Huh.
I don't believe it.
Hey.
I'm just...
I'm so sorry.
I loved your mom, I really did.
I know.
It's good to see ya.
What are you doing here?
Just keepin' an eye
on the place till we sell it.
Sell it?
Where's Bix?
Where is she?
Cass...
Where is she?
<i>"There will be times

<i>"I know this already.</i>
<i>"Alone, unsure,</i>
<i>"dwarfed by the scale of the enemy.</i>
<i>"Remember this.

<i>"It occurs spontaneously
and without instruction.</i>

We've loosened air traffic
as you requested.
Pulled back our uniform patrols,
relaxed our curfew.
We've baited the trap and opened the door.
We've got recon units
prepped and positioned.
I know you've got
your own sources out there.
What time is the funeral?
They asked for midday.
We pushed it back two hours.
They slow down a bit after lunch.
And the funeral area?
Right there. That's her box.
We're allowing them
half of Rix Road for one block.
We gave them a max of 30 people.
The Daughters pushed back,
so we've upped it to 40.
"Daughters"?
The Daughters of Ferrix.
It's a social club.
Andor's mother was a past president.
A local annoyance.
The control position's here,
here, and here.
We'll have snipers
and a containment unit there.
Containment, yes. Snipers, no.
I want him taken alive.
I want that message passed along the line.
And clearly.
"Where would I get the money?"
"That's what scares me the most."
That's right. Word for word.
Was she more angry about him lying
or the possibility of gambling debts?
Hard to say.
Mon Mothma is of great interest here.
Having her husband dig a hole
for himself could be helpful in many ways.
Well, it sounded like
Perrin had done this before.
They've made some
odd banking moves recently.
This would certainly explain it.
Kreegyr. You're missing it.
Keep listening.
You can close out your Anto Kreegyr files.
How many attacked?
They're still counting the bodies.
It's over?
They walked right into it.
It was over before they started.
Prisoners?
Not today.
Take a guess who's not happy about that.
She called in.
He's been talking her down.
<i>I just wish
I had been part of the conversation, sir.</i>
This wasn't a dialogue, Dedra.
We get nothing from a dead body.
Someone needs to be
in the room saying that.
<i>You're missing the point.</i>
Today was about wiping the taste
of Aldhani from the Emperor's mouth.
You want to start a conversation?
Find Axis.
That's not him.
<i>- Sir?</i>
- The big man.
We've been played.
Where is he?
Okay.
Make it quick.
I wanted her to leave with me.
- I know.
- I came to get her.
She told me.
I couldn't get back.
You shouldn't be here now, Cass.
- But the last time I saw her, we argued.
- Don't.
- I told her I was coming back.
- Stop.
- I never should have left that morning.
- Stop.
She told me you'd say all this.
"Tell him, none of this is his fault.
"It was already burning.
He's just the first spark of the fire.
"Tell him,
he knows everything he needs to know
"and feels everything he needs to feel.
"And when the day comes,
and those two pull together,
"he will be
an unstoppable force for good.
"Tell him...
"I love him more than anything
he could ever do wrong."
- Hey.
- Who's that?
There's different shifts
that they're taking.
Street's clear. Hurry up.
- Bix?
- Still got friends in the hotel.
- She was alive three days ago.
- Why are they keeping her?
She must know something.
We can't just leave her there.
You're gonna take on a full garrison?
I'll take care of Maarva.
You take care of yourself.
It's too late for that.
Any luck?
Was getting worried.
What's the verdict?
Has he come home or not?
They seem to think so.
They're everywhere.
- There's an ISB supervisor in town.
- A woman?
You know her?
Not yet.
This is good.
How is this possibly good?
They'll do the hunting for us.
They'll want him alive.
They'll find him, we'll kill him.
Where will they take him?
The hotel.
So that's our target.
We just need him dead
before they start asking questions.
How long do we have
before the festivities start?
Few hours. You'll hear the anvil.
- Where's Cinta?
- Watching the mother's house.
Oh, forget that.
Get her up to the hotel.
I'll have a look around.
What's going on?
Get Cinta. I'll be at the hotel.
What's going on?
I'm not sure.
<i>I can hear music, sir.</i>
<i>Of course I hear it.</i>
I'm just not seeing it.
They've started.
They're coming from all over town.
I want everything out here.
Show of force immediately.
Stand to!
Double time, form up.
Let's move!
You call this a perimeter?
Square this away!
Get these people off the streets.
Team one here.
- Team two here.
- Go, go, go!
Team three...
Restrict them!
Move! Move! Move!
Go, go, go!
Move! Move! Move!
Take a unit down there.
You, Captain, take them that way.
- Double the reward.
- You found him?
I want twice as much
and a ride out of here when it's over.
- Where is he?
- Pretend you're arresting me.
- Hey!
- What do you think you're doing?
Hey. Move it. Move!
Right,
we need to assume the positions.
Secure the perimeter.
Back!
- Which building?
- Across the street.
- I need two men.
- He's seen him?
- No, but he's sure he's there.
- We're wasting time.
I've got a recon unit
on the terrace up there now...
No. I need him alive.
Don't make me say it again.
Sir.
She's here.
It's her.
- What are we doing?
- We're wasting time.
Stone and sky. Stone and sky.
Stone and sky. Stone and sky...
Stone and sky.
- Tenek.
- Cassian.
Where's Bix?
I'm sorry about your mother.
<i>My name is Maarva Carassi Andor.</i>
<i>I'm honored to stand before you.</i>
<i>I'm honored
to be a Daughter of Ferrix,</i>
<i>and honored to be worthy of the stone.</i>
<i>Strange, I...</i>
<i>feel as if I can see it.</i>
<i>I was six, I think,
first time I touched a funerary stone.</i>
<i>Heard our music, felt our history.</i>
<i>Holding my sister's hand as we walked
all the way from Fountain Square.</i>
<i>Where you stand now,
I've been more times than I can remember.</i>
<i>I always wanted to be lifted.</i>
<i>I was always eager,
always waiting to be inspired.</i>
<i>I remember every time it happened,
every time the dead lifted me...</i>
<i>With their truth.</i>
<i>And now I'm dead.</i>
<i>And I yearn to lift you.</i>
<i>Not because I want to shine
or even be remembered.</i>
<i>It's because I want you to go on.</i>
<i>I want Ferrix to continue.</i>
<i>In my waning hours,
that's what comforts me most.</i>
<i>But I fear for you.</i>
<i>We've been sleeping.</i>
<i>We've had each other,
and Ferrix, our work, our days.</i>
<i>We had each other, and they left us alone.</i>
<i>We kept the trade lanes open,
and they left us alone.</i>
<i>We took their money and ignored them,</i>
<i>we kept their engines churning,</i>
<i>and the moment they pulled away,
we forgot them.</i>
<i>Because we had each other.</i>
<i>We had Ferrix.</i>
<i>But we were sleeping.</i>
<i>I've been sleeping.</i>
<i>And I've been turning away from the truth
I wanted not to face.</i>
<i>There is a wound that won't heal
at the center of the galaxy.</i>
<i>There is a darkness reaching like rust
into everything around us.</i>
<i>We let it grow, and now it's here.</i>
<i>It's here, and it's not visiting anymore.</i>
<i>It wants to stay.</i>
<i>The Empire is a disease
that thrives in darkness,</i>
<i>it is never more alive than when we sleep.</i>
<i>It's easy for the dead
to tell you to fight,</i>
<i>and maybe it's true,
maybe fighting is useless.</i>
<i>Perhaps it's too late.</i>
<i>But I'll tell you this...</i>
<i>If I could do it again,</i>
<i>I'd wake up early
and be fighting these bastards...</i>
Move!
<i>...from the start.</i>
<i>Fight the Empire!</i>
Enough!
No!
Placement!
Let him through!
Hold the line!
Let him through!
Let him through!
Let him through.
Hold the line!
Hold the line!
Hold the line!
You! Bell tower, make it stop now!
Go!
Hold the line!
I dreamt you came back.
Bix?
You climbed over a wall.
Hey, listen, we gotta get outta here.
Maarva was here.
Wasn't she great?
Get him up!
Move, move!
There's no one out there. Come on.
They'll get angry.
No.
Ah!
Oh, my God...
Come. Come.
There you go.
Come on, let's get moving. Come on.
Keep moving!
There! That's him!
Get him!
- Hold the line!
- Open fire!
Fire at will!
Come on!
- Move!
- Get him!
Ah!
Ah!
You.
What are you doing here?
Okay.
Do as I say. Move!
Straight ahead. Through the door.
Quickly!
You?
How?
You were in trouble.
Syril.
I knew that.
I should...
I should say thank you.
You don't have to.
What about this?
Everything goes.
- Closet?
- Empty.
- You're bleeding.
- It's fine.
That's blood.
It's nothing.
It's not mine.
Come on, guys.
The fuel gauge says zero.
I've got nothing.
It's topped out. It's reading full.
Do you wanna come up here and see?
Bang the gauge, Jezz.
Just give it a whack.
It's got a few kinks,
but it's a good old ship.
I'd have more confidence
if you were coming.
It flies.
Pull it! Pull it!
We're full!
Give me those.
Now, go.
You go now or forget it.
No.
C-C-Cassian.
- Get it going!
- Almost there.
Hey.
- Help her up.
- Brasso.
She's coming around. Come on.
Let's get moving!
Come. Come with me.
- Hey, Jezz.
- Hey, Cass.
Can they make it to Gangi Moon?
If they ever make it out of here.
You're not coming?
Stay low all the way to Farside Sea.
The moment you get over the water,
you climb.
Straight home, full pump,
hand throttle, no comms.
All in. You understand?
Yeah.
You're n-n-not coming?
Not today, Bee.
I n-n-never got to see you.
You take care of Bix until I get there.
I'm counting on you.
You always say that.
And you always come through.
Get them out of here!
He'll find us.
Cassian will find us.
I will.
I'll find you.
Now, go! Go, go!
Prepare for evac.
Full stealth.
You came here to kill me, didn't you?
You don't make it easy.
I will now.
What game is this?
No game.
Kill me.
Or take me in.
