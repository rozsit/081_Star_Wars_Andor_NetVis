1
00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:03,209
Something's wrong on Two.

2
00:00:03,293 --> 00:00:04,966
Something's really wrong on Two.

3
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:06,375
Look at me.

4
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:09,084
It takes a week for one word
to get all the way up here.

5
00:00:09,168 --> 00:00:10,584
You're panicking about something

6
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:12,834
that's happening
on the other side of the building!

7
00:00:14,584 --> 00:00:15,834
You think they're listening?

8
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:17,125
Like you would know.

9
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:18,625
I know this.

10
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:19,834
They don't need to care.

11
00:00:19,918 --> 00:00:22,667
All they need to do
is turn this floor on twice a day

12
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:24,792
and keep their numbers rolling.

13
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:25,917
<i>I need a loan.</i>

14
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,834
You have someone in mind.

15
00:00:27,918 --> 00:00:29,042
It's not a long list.

16
00:00:29,126 --> 00:00:30,793
And yet you're afraid to say who it is.

17
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:32,709
Davo Sculdun.

18
00:00:32,793 --> 00:00:34,001
He is not a banker.

19
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:35,751
He's a thug.

20
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:38,625
Your breathing sounds weak.

21
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:41,376
The doctor was here yesterday.

22
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:43,793
You really don't know where he is?

23
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:46,334
New man on the floor!

24
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:48,917
Hold your positions!

25
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:50,542
I have a new idea.

26
00:00:54,418 --> 00:00:55,559
<i>Anto Kreegyr.</i>

27
00:00:55,644 --> 00:00:57,250
- I want you to meet him.
- Anto Kreegyr?

28
00:00:57,334 --> 00:01:00,334
He's been probing
the Imperial power station at Spellhaus.

29
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:03,417
We've got a rebel pilot in custody.
One of Anto Kreegyr's group.

30
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:05,709
We don't think Kreegyr knows
he's gone missing yet.

31
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:07,042
What if we foul the ship?

32
00:01:07,126 --> 00:01:09,000
Have the pilot found dead in the cockpit.

33
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:11,959
Make it so.
Top priority. Quickly and carefully.

34
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:13,459
We leave no trace.

35
00:01:13,543 --> 00:01:16,418
- What, you can't save him?
- There's nothing to save.

36
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,126
He's had a massive stroke.

37
00:01:20,793 --> 00:01:22,875
What happened down on Two?

38
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,834
A man who was just released on Four
ended up back on Two the next day.

39
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:29,876
Word got out on the floor,
and then they killed them all.

40
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:32,500
No one's getting out, are they?

41
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:33,584
Not now.

42
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:35,418
Not after this.

43
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,792
We need to go tomorrow.

44
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:14,251
- Tomorrow?
- You heard me.

45
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:16,959
Go where?

46
00:03:17,543 --> 00:03:18,542
Anywhere.

47
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:19,668
It has to be tomorrow.

48
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:22,125
- Tomorrow.
- We can't wait.

49
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:23,668
We'll never have a better chance.

50
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:27,126
- You sound insane.
- No, listen to me.

51
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:30,334
They don't have enough guards,
and they know it.

52
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,542
They're afraid. Right now, they're afraid.

53
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:34,917
Afraid? Afraid of what?

54
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:37,501
They just killed a hundred men
to keep them quiet.

55
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,709
- What would you call that?
- I'd call that power.

56
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:43,334
Power? Power doesn't panic.

57
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,334
Five thousand men are about to find out
they're never leaving here alive.

58
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:52,418
Don't you think
that worries them upstairs?

59
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:56,375
Whatever we're making here,
it's clearly something they need.

60
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,584
They can't afford to be surprised again.

61
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:04,209
There'll never be less guards
than tomorrow. You know that.

62
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:05,292
On-Program.

63
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:07,959
Everyday we wait, they get stronger.

64
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:10,459
- It might be wise to have a plan.
- We have a plan.

65
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,667
Oh, what? You and Birnok and Melshi?

66
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:15,292
You don't have time to be stupid!

67
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:16,376
Come on!

68
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:20,668
The plan works around
the new man coming down.

69
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:23,668
They'll replace Ulaf tomorrow.

70
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:27,125
That might not happen again
until it's too late.

71
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:31,793
I'd rather die trying to take them down
than die giving them what they want.

72
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:37,501
We won't have a better chance.

73
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:41,001
It has to be tomorrow.

74
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:43,626
Program.

75
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,042
<i>Home Blue,
proceed directly to your cell.</i>

76
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,209
Keef, where is he?

77
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:55,542
He's dead.

78
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:56,625
He didn't make it?

79
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:57,709
What happened?

80
00:04:57,793 --> 00:04:59,375
He's dead. Can't you see that?

81
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:01,584
- Who was it?
- Ulaf, the old guy.

82
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,167
New man tomorrow.

83
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,625
What's going on?

84
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,334
Tell them.

85
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:07,667
Collapsed in the walk way.

86
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:09,209
- Tell them!
- Tell us what?

87
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,084
What happened?

88
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:12,417
A doctor came out.

89
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:14,042
He didn't do much, did he?

90
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:15,125
Kino?

91
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:17,375
<i>We will have immediate
facility compliance</i>

92
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:20,542
<i>or we will begin activating floors
without warning.</i>

93
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:21,625
Keef! Floor!

94
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:24,709
What's going on?

95
00:05:24,793 --> 00:05:26,750
The doctor told us
what happened down on Two.

96
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:27,834
It's true, isn't it?

97
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:29,125
They fried the whole bridge.

98
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:30,418
It is worse than that.

99
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:32,667
- It's why.
- Louder.

100
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:34,584
He said they made a mistake,

101
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,834
and sent back a man
who'd just been released.

102
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:40,000
- They fried two shifts to keep it quiet.
- You heard him say this?

103
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:41,334
How would he know?

104
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:42,750
I don't believe it.

105
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,542
He's a doctor,
they would never tell...

106
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:47,418
No one is getting out!

107
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:04,293
It's true.

108
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:08,334
The rumors are true.

109
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:10,667
He said it's true.

110
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:12,084
They're not letting us go.

111
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:14,501
Ever.

112
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:18,918
We're gonna die here,

113
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:21,043
or in the next place.

114
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:27,293
So let's get out heads back in our cells,

115
00:06:29,293 --> 00:06:30,834
and start figuring this out.

116
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,834
<i>Kreegyr's men took the bait.</i>

117
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:43,834
They're asking for a landing bay.

118
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:46,500
- They found it?
- They're towing it, sir.

119
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:47,875
"Pilot dead. Ship adrift.

120
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,543
"Port of origin unknown.

121
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:54,167
"Kafrene Rescue Salvage
reports unresponsive, GPE 7000.

122
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:58,792
"Operator appears to have frozen following
hydraulic failure on hyperspace re-entry."

123
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,125
It worked.

124
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:01,834
Now we hang back and wait.

125
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:03,542
- Suggestion, sir?
- Yes.

126
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:05,292
I don't think we should step away.

127
00:07:05,376 --> 00:07:07,375
- Go on.
- We should do what we normally do.

128
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,792
Unidentified ship, dead pilot.
We'd want to take a look, wouldn't we?

129
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:12,625
Let's assume Kreegyr's watching.

130
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:15,792
The least suspicious thing to do
would be to take an interest.

131
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:17,668
That is exactly what we will do.

132
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:39,168
Listen up!

133
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:45,001
We are done with counting shifts.

134
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:48,418
There is only then and now.

135
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:52,209
There is only one way out.

136
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:54,126
Play it how you want.

137
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:57,834
But I'm gonna assume I'm already dead,

138
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:00,043
and take it from there.

139
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:02,709
There's no sense
in warning the night shift.

140
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:06,293
They'll hear about it
one way or another soon enough.

141
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:09,418
Let's make it look good.

142
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,959
<i>New protocol announcement.</i>

143
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:28,084
<i>All sky bridge transfers will be On-Program
and silent until further notice.</i>

144
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:32,168
<i>Any shift not in full compliance
will be punished collectively.</i>

145
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:34,625
<i>On-Program now.</i>

146
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:36,251
On-Program!

147
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:41,167
And turn.

148
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:51,293
- Ready?
- Yeah.

149
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:22,959
Doctor Mullmoy,
we're just not sure what to do.

150
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:27,125
She needs her meds, she knows it,
but we caught her hiding them now,

151
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,375
and when I asked her
what she thought she was up to

152
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,292
she said your pills put her off of food,

153
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:34,042
and she'd rather keep eating
than let you keep pretending.

154
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:35,543
Okay, where is she?

155
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,043
- It's over there.
- Got it. Thanks.

156
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:46,959
I was here once, 30 years ago.

157
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:49,375
I'd just left Chandrila,

158
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:52,125
and my boss at the time
thought I'd enjoy seeing it.

159
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:53,418
Has it changed much?

160
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,126
I can't tell.

161
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:57,542
Didn't pay enough attention.

162
00:09:57,626 --> 00:10:00,709
Suppose I thought
I'd be coming back regularly.

163
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:02,042
It's State property.

164
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:05,959
The rules are strict on décor.
Our choices for change are limited.

165
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:08,043
It's a bit old, isn't it?

166
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,834
I like new.

167
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:15,334
I know it's tasteless and cliché,

168
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:19,584
but one of the indulgences of great wealth
is freedom from other people's opinions.

169
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:21,918
You've made your point.

170
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:25,042
Yes, everyone says you're very direct.

171
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:27,375
The Senator has many obligations,

172
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,793
she's learned to manage
her time accordingly.

173
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,375
I like when things are clear.

174
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:36,875
But then I always get to thinking,
what's around the corner?

175
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,459
Mmm, your curiosity
has clearly been profitable.

176
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:42,792
I've met your husband several times.

177
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:43,876
I'm sure.

178
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:48,667
I take it that's not a corner
we're turning in this conversation.

179
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:50,126
It is not.

180
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:54,792
Many cultures don't fully appreciate
the clarity of the Chandrilan marriage.

181
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:57,001
Even our own people are confused at times.

182
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:59,501
Boundaries can be liberating.

183
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,001
The old ways have value.

184
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,000
Good.

185
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:05,334
We understand each other.

186
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:10,834
So, searching for a more
fluid banking situation, are we?

187
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:13,126
We've discussed all this, Davo.

188
00:11:14,126 --> 00:11:15,584
I'd like to hear her say it.

189
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:21,084
Yes.

190
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:25,334
We're exploring alternative
financing arrangements for our foundation.

191
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:28,709
As Tay has no doubt
already told you,

192
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:30,792
we've reached a scale in our holdings

193
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:33,084
that permits
a great variety of transactions

194
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:37,834
to be bundled in ways
that make outside observation impossible.

195
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:39,543
Yes, I've been informed.

196
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:44,167
What's unfortunate
is that people such as yourself,

197
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,209
those with immaculate reputations,

198
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:49,250
sometimes feel that by taking advantage
of the opportunity

199
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,167
they're somehow tarnished.

200
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:52,501
The money is yours.

201
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:55,000
Family wealth is a thing to be proud of

202
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:58,751
and you ought to be able to move it
as you like with your privacy intact.

203
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:03,917
The Empire's new regulations, made without
Senate consultation, I might add,

204
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:06,667
are as cumbersome as they are avoidable.

205
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:09,584
They've made a game of it and we play.

206
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:13,209
This is a charitable fund
we're establishing.

207
00:12:13,293 --> 00:12:14,334
So I've been told.

208
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:19,084
- What will it cost?
- My fee?

209
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:21,875
We assume it's a percentage
of funds transferred.

210
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,209
I want no fee.

211
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:25,626
Money means very little to me
at this point.

212
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:28,251
Charity, isn't it?

213
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:31,959
- I insist.
- And I refuse.

214
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:36,084
Please take no offense,
I'd prefer not to owe any favors.

215
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:39,626
I'd feel far more comfortable
paying you for your trouble.

216
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:44,876
A drop of discomfort
may be the price of doing business.

217
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:50,793
Let's have it.

218
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,042
I'd like a return invitation.

219
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:56,543
I'd like to come back here at least once.

220
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,917
I'm sure that's something
that can be arranged.

221
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:01,875
I have a 14-year-old son.

222
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:03,501
I'd like to bring him with me.

223
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:08,668
You can't be serious.

224
00:13:10,334 --> 00:13:13,459
- I'm not asking for betrothal.
- Then what are we talking about?

225
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,875
An introduction.

226
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,334
Your daughter is 13.
She'll soon come of age.

227
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:19,000
Two young people.

228
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:21,709
Attractive and privileged
Chandrilan citizens.

229
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:26,125
What makes you think
I approve of that tradition?

230
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:31,542
Our position sometimes makes decisions
for us, don't you find, Senator?

231
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:35,293
Neither of us have lived a life
that encourages nonconformity.

232
00:13:36,793 --> 00:13:39,001
Is that your only offer?

233
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:40,542
I'm afraid so.

234
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:41,876
Tay will see you out.

235
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:45,834
Of course.

236
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:53,501
- It's a lot to think about.
- I'm not thinking about it.

237
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:59,126
That's the first untrue thing you've said.

238
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:02,168
It's been a pleasure.

239
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:24,459
There was a mark on the fountain.

240
00:14:25,043 --> 00:14:26,043
Could be anything.

241
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:29,209
That's what I thought,
so I went to the stairs.

242
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:32,167
The rail was gone.

243
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:33,584
A clean break. Fresh.

244
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:37,084
He wants a meeting, face to face.

245
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,250
There goes the day.

246
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:40,375
I don't like it.

247
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:42,042
Not now, I don't like the timing.

248
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:43,375
You don't like anything.

249
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:45,584
At the very least
you need to let me go.

250
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:48,125
Take the Fondor, go to safety
and I'll take care of it.

251
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:50,000
You know that's not happening.

252
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:51,459
Stop wasting time.

253
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:53,876
It's been a year.

254
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:56,625
I'm surprised he waited this long.

255
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:58,250
Then if it's a trap?

256
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:01,043
Oh, if it's a trap, we've already lost.

257
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:04,375
Hands away.

258
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:07,126
Are we really doing this?

259
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:10,667
- You're still on board?
- I want out. Don't care how.

260
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:12,042
I'm dead. I'm dead.

261
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:13,834
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I'm pretending to be dead.

262
00:15:15,376 --> 00:15:17,376
Don't die until you put up a fight.

263
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:22,542
One way out.

264
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:23,709
Come on!

265
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:26,709
Keep it moving!

266
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:30,250
Come on!

267
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:33,084
Pick it up.

268
00:15:41,251 --> 00:15:45,542
Right now, I'm two racks behind!

269
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:51,251
And we are not
gonna close out the shift like that!

270
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:05,543
Stop right there.

271
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:09,626
On-Program. Hands on your head.
Eyes front. Feet down.

272
00:16:13,293 --> 00:16:14,500
Keep it moving!

273
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:17,542
Come on, come on.

274
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:18,917
Come on!

275
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,168
Step forward, move, stop there.

276
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,292
Zap-rod.

277
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:30,667
If I have to use this,
you'll remember it, yes? Yes?

278
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:32,375
We owe a check on Three.

279
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,125
- Do that now.
- We're already behind.

280
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:36,084
- Stepping off.
- You're good.

281
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:38,125
I said eyes front.

282
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,251
Where is he?

283
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,375
- Are they even watching?
- Calm down.

284
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,793
- How?
- I thought you were dead already.

285
00:16:57,626 --> 00:17:01,250
New man ready on 5-2-D,
requesting unit override.

286
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:02,667
How's it looking out there?

287
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:04,418
<i>Copy that, coming up.</i>

288
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:08,250
Looks good.

289
00:17:10,418 --> 00:17:11,417
Okay, go.

290
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,043
Oh, no.

291
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,084
<i>On-Program.</i>

292
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,042
<i>On-Program.</i>

293
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:43,542
<i>New man on the floor.
Everyone hold positions.</i>

294
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:45,334
New man on the floor!

295
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:47,126
Hold your positions!

296
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:58,668
Lift engaged.

297
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:07,500
- What'd you say to me?
- I said nothing.

298
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:09,750
If you wanna say something,
you should say it now.

299
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:11,042
You start...

300
00:19:11,126 --> 00:19:13,667
Hey! You lot, back on program!

301
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:18,625
You lot, back on program!

302
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:20,668
Get back on program!

303
00:19:23,668 --> 00:19:25,168
Whoa, what's going on? What's that?

304
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:27,584
Now!

305
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:33,042
What's going on out there?

306
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:34,834
Go! Go!

307
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:41,000
- Clear the target.
- What are you doing?

308
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:56,125
- Come on! Help them!
- Let's go!

309
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:57,709
Attack!

310
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:25,709
Spark the floor! Spark the floor!

311
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,334
Get on the tables!

312
00:20:27,418 --> 00:20:30,917
Get on the tables! Get up on the tables!

313
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:32,043
Spark the floor!

314
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:41,501
Talk to me!

315
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:47,376
Right, are you all right?

316
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:51,816
- You all right? You good?
- I'm okay.

317
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,084
Attack!

318
00:20:56,293 --> 00:20:58,250
We have a situation on 5-2-D.

319
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:00,167
Repeat, we have a situation...

320
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:13,001
No! Xaul!

321
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:16,251
Come on!

322
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:21,418
Hey!

323
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:27,375
They're down!

324
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:29,500
Come on! Climb!

325
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,001
We're in!

326
00:21:48,168 --> 00:21:49,168
Right.

327
00:21:49,668 --> 00:21:50,751
Gimme a hand.

328
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:57,125
That's it. Go.

329
00:22:00,209 --> 00:22:01,418
Got it.

330
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:04,334
- Hey, did you see that?
- Yeah, hold up.

331
00:22:04,418 --> 00:22:05,459
What's that?

332
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:07,023
Where's that coming from?

333
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:10,751
Hand it off.

334
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:13,959
Move!

335
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,000
- Kino, come on!
- We need to hold the level!

336
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:20,750
- Let someone else do that.
- Go! Go!

337
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:21,959
Blow the consoles!

338
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:23,334
Keep the doors open!

339
00:22:25,793 --> 00:22:27,959
<i>- What's going on down there?</i>
- I'm not sure, Sir...

340
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:29,542
<i>I'm looking at a water break.</i>

341
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:31,459
I've got service warnings on every panel.

342
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:33,500
<i>Get over there
and check it out. Now.</i>

343
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:35,793
Check out 5-2-D. Now!

344
00:22:39,543 --> 00:22:40,668
Let's go. Okay.

345
00:22:41,418 --> 00:22:42,834
Go, go.

346
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:46,709
- Jemboc!
- Taga, come on, let's go!

347
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:50,459
Let's go!

348
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:54,584
Let's go. Fall in. Come on.

349
00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:55,959
Go! Go! Go!

350
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:07,959
One way out!

351
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:10,209
Come and fight!

352
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:11,584
What?

353
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:18,125
Come on.

354
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:46,001
- Ah!
- We're leaving! Join us!

355
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:55,667
Climb! Use whatever you can!

356
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,293
Go!

357
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,292
<i>This is a facility-wide
emergency announcement.</i>

358
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:11,167
<i>Complete program protocol
will commence in 40 seconds.</i>

359
00:24:11,251 --> 00:24:15,375
Any deviation or failure to comply
will result in unit-wide activation.

360
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:17,625
- Start the count.
- Count engaged.

361
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:19,625
How much longer
to find the water break?

362
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,292
Techs waiting for a secure floor.

363
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,542
Isolate Five.

364
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:23,667
Locked in.

365
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:27,167
5-5, 5-3, 5-6. Burn a firewall around it.

366
00:24:27,251 --> 00:24:29,417
Fry the whole Level.
Make the epicenter 5-2.

367
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,501
Too late.

368
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:35,209
- There's nobody there.
- You shouldn't be here.

369
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:38,250
- Turn it off.
- Excuse me?

370
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:39,501
Turn it off!

371
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:42,250
That could mean so many things.

372
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:45,959
I... I'll turn it off.

373
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:47,709
Step away.

374
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:49,709
Now!

375
00:24:51,209 --> 00:24:54,001
- Shut down the floors. Everywhere.
- Do it.

376
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:57,834
No.

377
00:24:58,709 --> 00:24:59,876
Don't just turn it off.

378
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,125
Cut the power.

379
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,625
It's all hydro.

380
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:06,875
Once we turn it off it takes months
to get it back up and running ag...

381
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:08,168
I don't have it.

382
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,626
He has the Hydro Gens.

383
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,459
That's the backup power supply.

384
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:47,251
Get out of there.

385
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:50,918
There.

386
00:25:56,668 --> 00:25:57,668
With him.

387
00:25:58,501 --> 00:25:59,501
Move!

388
00:26:00,376 --> 00:26:02,751
On-Program! Now!

389
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:05,459
All yours.

390
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,501
Kino.

391
00:26:27,876 --> 00:26:29,043
Tell them what to do.

392
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,125
It has to be you.

393
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:34,251
Come on, Kino.

394
00:26:35,084 --> 00:26:36,792
You do this every day.

395
00:26:36,876 --> 00:26:38,668
Tell them what to do.

396
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:52,543
My name is Kino Loy.

397
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:57,001
<i>I'm the day shift manager on Level Five.</i>

398
00:26:58,793 --> 00:27:03,668
<i>I'm speaking to you
from the command center on Level Eight.</i>

399
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:09,792
We are, at this moment,
in control of the facility.

400
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:14,501
Is that the best you got?

401
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:21,501
How long we hang on, how far we get,

402
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:27,001
how many of us make it out,
all of that is now up to us.

403
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:32,543
We have deactivated
every floor in the facility.

404
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:37,001
<i>All floors are cold.</i>

405
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:45,500
<i>Wherever you are right now,
get up, stop the work.</i>

406
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:50,667
<i>Get out of your cells,
take charge and start climbing.</i>

407
00:27:50,751 --> 00:27:54,917
<i>They don't have enough guards
and they know it.</i>

408
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:56,667
<i>If we wait until they figure that out,</i>

409
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:57,792
it'll be too late.

410
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:04,209
We will never have
a better chance than this

411
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:10,334
and "I would rather die
trying to take them down

412
00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:12,959
"than giving them what they want."

413
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:20,168
We know they fried
a hundred men on Level Two.

414
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:26,084
We know that they are making up
our sentences as we go along.

415
00:28:26,168 --> 00:28:30,709
<i>We know that no one outside here
knows what's happening.</i>

416
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:35,750
<i>And now we know,
that when they say we are being released,</i>

417
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:39,959
we are being transferred
to some other prison

418
00:28:40,043 --> 00:28:45,584
to go and die and that ends today!

419
00:28:47,001 --> 00:28:49,750
There is one way out.

420
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:54,626
Right now, the building is ours.

421
00:28:56,043 --> 00:29:00,376
You need to run, climb, kill!

422
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:03,001
<i>You need to help each other.</i>

423
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:07,251
<i>You see someone who's confused,
someone who is lost,</i>

424
00:29:08,418 --> 00:29:10,292
you get them moving
and you keep them moving

425
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:13,459
until we put this place behind us.

426
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:16,709
<i>There are 5,000 of us.</i>

427
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:22,250
<i>If we can fight half as hard
as we've been working,</i>

428
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:24,751
<i>we will be home in no time.</i>

429
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:27,876
<i>One way out!</i>

430
00:29:28,668 --> 00:29:30,543
<i>One way out!</i>

431
00:29:31,584 --> 00:29:33,834
One way out!

432
00:29:33,918 --> 00:29:38,459
- One way out!
- One way out! One way out!

433
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,959
One way out!
One way out! One way out...

434
00:29:42,043 --> 00:29:43,043
Come on!

435
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:45,417
Let's get out of here!

436
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:05,209
Quiet.

437
00:30:18,001 --> 00:30:19,209
One way out!

438
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:24,293
Whatever happens now, we made it!

439
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:28,418
What's wrong?

440
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:30,459
Can't swim.

441
00:30:31,418 --> 00:30:33,376
- What?
- What did he say?

442
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:35,376
I can't swim!

443
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,043
<i>If this is a trap,
press the buttons for 215.</i>

444
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:08,667
<i>We'll have privacy.</i>

445
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:09,959
<i>We're running express.</i>

446
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:13,668
<i>First of all, congratulations.</i>

447
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:17,209
- On what?
<i>- Your daughter.</i>

448
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:20,293
<i>Healthy. Beautiful. You must be pleased.</i>

449
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,292
Is that meant to scare me?

450
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:29,209
<i>Well, it's been a year
since we've had a chance to catch up.</i>

451
00:32:29,293 --> 00:32:30,543
<i>You've become a father.</i>

452
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:33,459
<i>- It's not worth mentioning?</i>
- It's not fair.

453
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,459
You knowing.

454
00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:38,668
Watching me.

455
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:42,917
Do you ever think
how it might feel from my side?

456
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:45,084
<i>I think about you constantly.</i>

457
00:32:48,626 --> 00:32:50,667
<i>Why are we here tonight, Lonni?</i>

458
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:52,750
There's a new supervisor rising.

459
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:54,126
Dedra Meero.

460
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:57,334
She's focused
on a suspect she's calling Axis.

461
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:00,000
She thinks he's building a rebel network.

462
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:03,542
She started looking
into stolen Imperial Naval equipment

463
00:33:03,626 --> 00:33:07,084
and now she's looking
for a link to Aldhani.

464
00:33:08,459 --> 00:33:09,751
<i>Dedra Meero.</i>

465
00:33:10,668 --> 00:33:12,959
There was an incident on Ferrix
a few months ago.

466
00:33:13,043 --> 00:33:16,126
She thinks there's a link.
She's been tearing the place apart.

467
00:33:17,376 --> 00:33:21,918
They're searching
for a thief and the middleman.

468
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:23,959
<i>Huh. "Axis."</i>

469
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:26,667
She's gathering interest.
Partagaz likes her.

470
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:28,084
<i>Well, this is good.</i>

471
00:33:28,168 --> 00:33:29,459
<i>Encourage this.</i>

472
00:33:31,418 --> 00:33:32,709
Why is this good?

473
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:34,709
<i>Because she's wasting time.</i>

474
00:33:37,709 --> 00:33:39,500
You had nothing to do with Aldhani?

475
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,293
<i>Well, almost nothing.
We were invited, but declined.</i>

476
00:33:43,043 --> 00:33:45,209
<i>They got lucky. We don't build on luck.</i>

477
00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:48,251
<i>But this can't be why you're here.</i>

478
00:33:53,793 --> 00:33:57,126
She just captured a Rebel pilot
running supplies for Anto Kreegyr.

479
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:00,918
They turned him immediately
and staged an accident.

480
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:04,792
We know that there's a raid planned
on the power station at Spellhaus.

481
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,876
If Kreegyr attacks, they'll be waiting.

482
00:34:08,584 --> 00:34:11,792
<i>And if he doesn't,
they'll know something's amiss.</i>

483
00:34:11,876 --> 00:34:13,417
They'll be slaughtered.

484
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:14,709
<i>It's 50 men.</i>

485
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:17,834
<i>- You're worth more than that.</i>
- You have to warn them.

486
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,042
<i>To what end?</i>

487
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:20,459
<i>Ruin everything?</i>

488
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,459
<i>What better way to reassure the ISB</i>

489
00:34:23,543 --> 00:34:26,251
<i>there's no leak in security
than sacrificing Kreegyr.</i>

490
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:30,209
<i>I'm doing this for you
as much as anything.</i>

491
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:47,043
Tell me
why we're really here today, Lonni?

492
00:34:51,043 --> 00:34:52,668
I can't do this anymore.

493
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:55,626
I'm a father now.

494
00:34:57,584 --> 00:34:59,376
I had no idea how it would feel.

495
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:02,834
We took a vow.

496
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:08,501
I'm giving you Dedra Meero.

497
00:35:09,793 --> 00:35:11,792
I'm giving you Spellhaus.

498
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,376
I'm warning you about Ferrix.
I'm honoring my vow.

499
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:17,376
I've been working my way
through there for six years.

500
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:19,709
Working my way up.

501
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:21,793
Alone.

502
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:26,293
So, what was your plan?

503
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:30,918
Gather a big basket of goodies for me
as a farewell gift?

504
00:35:34,543 --> 00:35:36,751
What were you planning to tell the ISB?

505
00:35:39,376 --> 00:35:40,376
My health.

506
00:35:42,043 --> 00:35:44,875
My wife's family has an import business.

507
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:48,126
Even as you say the words,
you know it's impossible.

508
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,000
We can't let you go, Lonni.

509
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:52,293
We can't spare you.

510
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:54,542
We've been grooming you for too long.

511
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:56,168
And yes, you've been alone,

512
00:35:57,209 --> 00:36:00,876
but your career has profited greatly
from information that we've provided.

513
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,751
Information that cost me dearly.

514
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:06,209
You love your daughter.

515
00:36:06,918 --> 00:36:10,043
Kreegyr's men will be dying
to make sure she has a father.

516
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:12,709
You're trapped, Lonni.

517
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:16,668
There's no pleasure in saying it
but you're going nowhere.

518
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,001
My sacrifice?

519
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:24,334
It means nothing to you, does it?

520
00:36:26,293 --> 00:36:28,876
I said I think of you constantly and I do.

521
00:36:29,751 --> 00:36:32,959
Your investment in the Rebellion is epic.

522
00:36:33,043 --> 00:36:35,542
A double life? Every day a performance?

523
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,543
The stress of that?

524
00:36:38,584 --> 00:36:40,793
We need heroes, Lonni, and here you are.

525
00:36:42,376 --> 00:36:44,001
And what do you sacrifice?

526
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:53,626
Calm.

527
00:36:56,793 --> 00:36:58,459
Kindness. Kinship.

528
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:01,709
Love.

529
00:37:04,251 --> 00:37:06,375
I've given up all chance at inner peace.

530
00:37:06,459 --> 00:37:08,459
I've made my mind a sunless space.

531
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:12,834
I share my dreams with ghosts.

532
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:17,834
I wake up every day
to an equation I wrote 15 years ago

533
00:37:17,918 --> 00:37:21,918
from which there's only one conclusion,
I'm damned for what I do.

534
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:26,000
My anger, my ego,
my unwillingness to yield,

535
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:27,917
my eagerness to fight,

536
00:37:28,001 --> 00:37:30,459
they've set me on a path
from which there is no escape.

537
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:34,542
I yearned to be a savior against injustice
without contemplating the cost

538
00:37:34,626 --> 00:37:36,084
and by the time I looked down

539
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:38,709
there was no longer
any ground beneath my feet.

540
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:40,834
What is my sacrifice?

541
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:46,792
I'm condemned to use
the tools of my enemy to defeat them.

542
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:49,459
I burn my decency
for someone else's future.

543
00:37:49,543 --> 00:37:53,626
I burn my life to make a sunrise
that I know I'll never see.

544
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:58,625
And the ego that started this fight
will never have a mirror

545
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,876
or an audience or the light of gratitude.

546
00:38:03,376 --> 00:38:04,793
So what do I sacrifice?

547
00:38:07,334 --> 00:38:08,459
Everything!

548
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:17,709
You'll stay with me, Lonni.

549
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:21,709
I need all the heroes I can get.
