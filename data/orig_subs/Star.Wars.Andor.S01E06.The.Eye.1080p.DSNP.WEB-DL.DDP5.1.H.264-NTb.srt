1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,708
Wouldn't you rather give it all at once
to something real?

2
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:07,208
What would we be stealing?

3
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:10,916
The quarterly payroll
for an entire Imperial sector.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,625
That's why you're here? Revenge?

5
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,583
Yeah, that's good enough for now.

6
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,500
I didn't mark you for a team player.

7
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,583
Working with other people is never easy.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,416
<i>We're taking crates of payroll
from that vault,</i>

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,750
<i>loading the freighter,
and escaping out of the runway tunnel.</i>

10
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,666
Escaping? In a Rono?

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,875
You'll be lucky to make the horizon.

12
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,625
No one's stupid enough to try it.

13
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,291
No one but us.

14
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,041
It's about confidence.
We belong here.

15
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,208
We're followin' orders.

16
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,875
Wait!

17
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,666
Surprise from above
is never as shocking as one from below.

18
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,333
Don't move.

19
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:55,333
He comes here with nothin'
but the clothes on his back

20
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,375
and a stone worth 30,000 credits?

21
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,083
Who brings a treasure to a robbery?

22
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,333
I'm being paid.

23
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,000
You can't live with that?

24
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,791
I don't wanna walk in
looking over my shoulder.

25
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,750
<i>Looks just like your model.</i>

26
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,208
Should do.

27
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,083
I've had plenty of time to study,

28
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,291
and we've been
sneaking up here for months.

29
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,083
<i>There's nothing else
you can do, Luthen.</i>

30
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,958
They're either gonna be okay or not.

31
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,833
The thief. Andor.

32
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,291
I wasn't careful.

33
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,416
It'll all be over this time tomorrow.

34
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,791
Or it'll just be starting.

35
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,291
I couldn't sleep.

36
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
It's natural.

37
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,000
I need to be at my best.

38
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,250
Don't worry.

39
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,791
The excitement will kick in.

40
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,166
I'm struggling to understand
why my faith doesn't calm me.

41
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,250
I believe in something.
Why am I so unsettled?

42
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,166
I mean, you have nothing,
you sleep like a stone.

43
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,625
I write when I can't sleep.

44
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,958
Wrote about you last night.
Not you specifically, not "Clem."

45
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,041
Although I'm assuming
that's not your real name, anyway.

46
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:25,333
"The Role of Mercenaries
in The Galactic Struggle for Freedom."

47
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,291
My conclusion is simple.

48
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,541
Weapons are tools.

49
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,291
Those that use them are, by extension,

50
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,583
assets that we must use
to our best advantage.

51
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,166
The Empire has no moral boundaries,

52
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,875
why should we not take hold
of every chance we can?

53
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,458
Let them see how an insurgency adapts.

54
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:44,041
Well, you're half right.

55
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,958
The Empire doesn't play by the rules.

56
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,458
And how am I wrong?

57
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,375
They don't care enough to learn.

58
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,250
They don't have to.

59
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,958
You mean nothing to them.

60
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,416
Perhaps they'll think
differently tomorrow.

61
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,500
Be careful what you wish for.

62
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,458
So you think it's hopeless, do you?

63
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,166
Freedom? Independence? Justice?

64
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,041
We should just submit and be thankful?

65
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,375
Just take what we're given?

66
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,583
Do I look thankful to you?

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,291
No.

68
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,375
But I'm glad that you're here.

69
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,000
No matter what the reason.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,500
Don't worry.

71
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,041
You'll be fine.

72
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,291
You'll sleep when it's done.

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,791
The Dhanis, they're a simple people.

74
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,625
They breed a sad combination of traits

75
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,291
that make them particularly vulnerable
to manipulation.

76
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,250
<i>On a practical level,</i>

77
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,375
<i>they have great difficulty holding
multiple ideas simultaneously.</i>

78
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:05,875
We've found the best way to steer them
as we'd like is to offer alternatives.

79
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,375
You put a number of options on the table,
and they're so wrapped up in choosing,

80
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,875
they fail to notice
you've given them nothing

81
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,625
they thought they wanted at the start.

82
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,625
<i>Their deeper problem is pride.</i>

83
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:22,750
<i>The Dhanis would rather lose,
they'd rather suffer, than accept.</i>

84
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,583
<i>Which is wildly ironic</i>

85
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,000
<i>as they've choked down
everything we've thrown at them</i>

86
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,208
<i>these last 12 years.</i>

87
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,166
<i>It's a ten-day trek up from the Lowlands.</i>

88
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,875
<i>We offered them a transport
because we know they'll refuse,</i>

89
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,458
but then, along the way,
we've placed a series of "Comfort Units,"

90
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:41,625
shelters and taverns
with cheap local beverages.

91
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,208
Quite predictably,

92
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:48,750
what began as 500 pilgrims at the bottom
has already dwindled down to...

93
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,875
- Where are we now, Lieutenant?
- We counted 60 last night, sir.

94
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,375
They may pick up
some highland stragglers along the way,

95
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,083
but it's developing as we'd expected.

96
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,875
Not that long ago,
they'd put 15,000 out there.

97
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,791
Have they any idea this is the last time
they'll be allowed up here?

98
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,583
No, there's no profit in that.

99
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:09,083
We've spent the last decade promoting
an Imperial viewing festival

100
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,583
down in the Enterprise Zone.

101
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,250
They'll have that going forward.

102
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,375
It is their sacred valley, is it not?

103
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,041
Well, ultimately, they will return,
won't they, Colonel?

104
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,666
When you need plenty of arms and legs
to build all you've got planned.

105
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,333
You've been here the longest,
haven't you, Lieutenant?

106
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,083
Yes, sir. Seven years.

107
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,875
Will the Dhanis let us build
our new facility in peace?

108
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,541
I don't see them having a choice.

109
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,416
The Eye, Colonel, you're in for a treat.

110
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,958
It really is something to see.

111
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,166
Quite the celestial spectacle.

112
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,541
I'm looking forward to it.

113
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,791
Now, what do you make of him?

114
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,666
Colonel Petigar?

115
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,250
He's an engineer. You won't charm him.

116
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,041
Well, it won't be for lack of trying.

117
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,125
Are we secure?

118
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:16,166
I've brought in 30 sentries from Alkenzi.
I'll be supervising them.

119
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,250
I've sent our best men to the perimeters.

120
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,333
- Tonight must be perfect.
- That's the plan, sir.

121
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,416
Perfect.

122
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
I want that word ringing in your ears.

123
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,041
<i>Echo-One.</i>

124
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,875
Echo-One.

125
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,375
Echo-One.

126
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,041
Echo-One on spot.

127
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,166
Echo-One.

128
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,083
- Go ten up.
- What is that?

129
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,708
Fieldcomm. It's a battle radio.

130
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,208
Looks Imperial.

131
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,416
Not anymore.

132
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,041
Echo-One.

133
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,875
- Echo-One.
- Go three up.

134
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,238
What? It's not working?

135
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,291
It will. It locks in.

136
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,916
When it does, it will carry on working
long after everything else is fried.

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,875
<i>Valley-One. Valley-One.</i>

138
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,333
<i>Valley-One, go. Valley-One.</i>

139
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,541
Valley-One. Valley-One on spot.

140
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,291
Valley-One. Valley-One.

141
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,916
<i>Echo engaged. Lockin' now.</i>

142
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,416
Lock and confirm, Echo. Lock and confirm.

143
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,416
Confirm. We're locked in.

144
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,291
<i>We're dialed in.</i>

145
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,291
<i>Movin' now.</i>

146
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,458
Safe travels.

147
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,541
<i>And to you.</i>

148
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,833
Valley-One out.

149
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,958
Let's pick it up.

150
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,916
Fallin' behind.

151
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,625
He likes giving orders, doesn't he?

152
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,458
Makes sense, right?

153
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,375
What do you mean?

154
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,583
They didn't tell you, did they?

155
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,458
He was a stormtrooper.

156
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,583
Really?

157
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,125
Pick it up!

158
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,833
You should've been here
when Cinta found out.

159
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,458
They slaughtered her whole family.

160
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,333
Pick it up.

161
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,666
Has it started?

162
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,375
Well, the Dhanis
don't believe it ever ends.

163
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,791
So, yes, sir, it has definitely started.

164
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,458
Gorn here. Go ahead.

165
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,125
<i>Low Road Unit reporting, sir.</i>

166
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,541
The guests are arriving.

167
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,048
<i>Let's have a peaceful welcome.</i>

168
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:47,916
Will do, sir.

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Form up!

170
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,583
But do it quietly.

171
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,333
<i>Tighten up. Eyes front.</i>

172
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,916
<i>They'll be here any minute.</i>

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,541
<i>You're a soldier now, Clem.</i>

174
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,166
<i>These people hate us.</i>

175
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,000
<i>The ones that have climbed this far
have made a life of it.</i>

176
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,625
<i>Do not engage.</i>

177
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,500
We meet soldiers from the garrison?
We're from Alkenzi.

178
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,791
They're from Alkenzi?
We're from the garrison.

179
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,416
Keep your mouths shut,
and remember, we belong here.

180
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,250
It might be best
if we split these up between us, and...

181
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,958
Hysterical.
I said, "You can't both be right."

182
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,125
They're just gonna be
waiting for him, right?

183
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,916
I had a good look at her.

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,916
Believe me, patience was not
the first thing that came to mind.

185
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,083
Oi, here comes another one.

186
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Whoo!

187
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,916
Oh, look at that.

188
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,791
Come on.

189
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,333
Let's get back to base.

190
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,458
Escort, march!

191
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:49,958
Roboda?

192
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,791
- Roboda.
- I'm dressing Leonart.

193
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,875
He's 12, he can dress himself.

194
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,541
Come and look at this sash.

195
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,875
None of this was stored properly.

196
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,000
It's all compressed.

197
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,458
Perhaps you've expanded.

198
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,916
Where's his Imperial blouse?

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,125
I'm not wearing that.

200
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,666
You'll do as you're told.

201
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,625
Mother, I don't feel well.

202
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,625
You'll make an effort tonight
if it kills you.

203
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,875
He might have a fever.

204
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,166
- He might feel the back of my hand.
- The boy is ill, Jayhold.

205
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,000
He's always ill.

206
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,416
Look, you wanna get out of here, do you?

207
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,041
Get that transfer,
leave this stinking planet?

208
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,583
You certainly whine about it enough.

209
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,208
Colonel Petigar
will be making those decisions.

210
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,166
Now, I want everyone
on their best behavior this evening.

211
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,125
I look forward to seeing that.

212
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,916
Company, halt!

213
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,666
Squad, halt!

214
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,583
Let them pass.

215
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,041
Quick, march!

216
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,625
Get ready. I think I hear two coming.

217
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,291
Let's go.

218
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,875
You were right.

219
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,416
I'm not tired at all.

220
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,375
Tighten up.

221
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,500
All right, listen up!

222
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,875
Squads One, Two, and Four,
you're here for the night.

223
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,083
Get comfortable.

224
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,291
I want no surprises.

225
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,500
Squad Three, standby.

226
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,833
You'll be joining the return escort
with the Commandant and his family.

227
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,958
If you don't bother them,
they won't bother you.

228
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,291
So I want mouths shut and eyes open.

229
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,916
Corporal.

230
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,041
Right turn.

231
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,375
With me.

232
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,041
Squad, halt!

233
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,000
Everybody ready?

234
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,208
Ah, the skin?

235
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,625
We trade goat hides
for a three-year lease.

236
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,083
If they didn't smell so badly,
it might be amusing.

237
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,500
Come on, you two.

238
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,041
The Dhanis have a rough appetite
for fragrance.

239
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,375
Yes, I've been warned.

240
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:54,041
A bit of ceremonial nonsense,
and we can tuck into a fine table.

241
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,875
Above the stench.

242
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,083
Has she checked in?

243
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,208
Not yet.

244
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,375
Problem?

245
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,916
She'll be there.

246
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,291
Wrong time to mess up.

247
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,625
They were supposed to call us!

248
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,948
- When are you gonna learn?
- We were waiting!

249
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,291
You were waiting?

250
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,708
That's your excuse?

251
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,291
You should know better.

252
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,041
Don't let Gorn catch you.

253
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,500
<i>Alkenzi Wing Seven.</i>

254
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,125
<i>Eastern sweep completed.</i>

255
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,250
<i>Returning to base.</i>

256
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,666
Attention!

257
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,708
Corporal.

258
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,416
Sir.

259
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,250
These men from Alkenzi?

260
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,458
Yes, sir.

261
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:14,166
- You do the talking, eh?
- Yes, sir.

262
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,875
Let's make quick work of it.

263
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,458
Where is she? We're late.

264
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,708
Random.

265
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,958
Alkenzi?

266
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,875
No, they're shutting down right now.

267
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,458
Everything's grounded.

268
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,208
No one wants to be up in this.

269
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,708
Vel, get down.

270
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,416
It's solid?

271
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,125
Call them.

272
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,416
You're sure?

273
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,625
You're stalling.

274
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,083
<i>Echo-One.</i>

275
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,708
<i>Echo-One.</i>

276
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,625
<i>Echo-One. Echo.</i>

277
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:43,791
Echo-One.

278
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,000
<i>Echo-One.</i>

279
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,833
<i>Echo-One.</i>

280
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:51,916
Valley-One.

281
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,291
<i>Valley-One at go.</i>

282
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,083
Call it.

283
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,791
Are you on point?

284
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,041
<i>Yes.</i>

285
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,625
<i>We're here on point.</i>

286
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,291
Are we going or not?

287
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,791
Vel.

288
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,458
Go.

289
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,083
<i>We go.</i>

290
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,166
Copy.

291
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,416
He says,
"May The Eye find the good in all of us."

292
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,541
Indeed.

293
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:35,541
Tell him we'll give him the gift
of our absence and be on our way.

294
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,166
- Corporal.
- At your service.

295
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,000
Fall in.

296
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,000
Right turn.

297
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,708
With me.

298
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,333
Sir.

299
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,142
- Everything in order?
- Yes, sir.

300
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,309
You take the point
and send your men down.

301
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,208
I want no one up here
without my permission.

302
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,458
Will do, sir.

303
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:50,166
You know, it's the old ones
causing all the problems.

304
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,541
Always trying to...

305
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,000
It'll all be much easier.

306
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,958
The days of passing skins

307
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,875
and ritual nonsense
will be soon behind us.

308
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:10,958
No great loss there.

309
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,708
It's not as if
there's much Aldhani civilization

310
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,125
to even forget about in the first place.

311
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,375
- Drop it. On the floor.
- What's all this?

312
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,416
- No!
- Drop it there.

313
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,458
Where's Lieutenant Gorn?

314
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,208
Down, on the ground. Down.

315
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,750
- What's the meaning of this?
- Be quiet!

316
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,166
- Move.
- Please.

317
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,750
- This is an outrage!
- Quiet! Stop talking!

318
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,250
Stop right there.

319
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,530
Let the boy go.

320
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,833
- Let the boy go!
- Jayhold...

321
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,166
Colonel, please.

322
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,291
Nobody has to die.

323
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,375
Everything all right, sir?

324
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,708
All good.

325
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,541
You can join your men
at the bottom of the hill now.

326
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,000
Enjoy the Eye.

327
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,416
Yes, sir.

328
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,625
Thank you, sir.

329
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,916
You'll never get out of here.

330
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:20,625
We're good.

331
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,791
- You do everything they tell you.
- Just what are you after?

332
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,708
You'll be taking us
to the payroll vault.

333
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,375
- That's insane.
- Or we die together.

334
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,083
- I can't open the vault.
- Time check.

335
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,958
- Falling behind.
- Go. We'll finish.

336
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,375
Didn't you hear me?

337
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,250
I don't control the vault!

338
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,875
It's on a code from the air base.

339
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:50,958
It's done remotely.

340
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,291
Keep lying
and it'll be a short night for you.

341
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,958
We know how the vault works.

342
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,958
We need your hand to key the sensor.

343
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,666
We can take just that if you'd prefer.

344
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,125
You'll never make it out.

345
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,666
- You better pray we do.
- You have no idea...

346
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,708
One path! One choice.

347
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,000
We win, or everyone dies.

348
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,333
Starts now.

349
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,875
Jayhold, please just do what they say.

350
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,750
Welcome, sir.

351
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,041
Put them down.

352
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,125
Down!

353
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,125
Against the wall. Move.

354
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,208
Move!

355
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,291
Down.

356
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,833
Sorry, just having a problem
with the comms.

357
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,375
Try the inverse channel.

358
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,708
Hands away from the console.

359
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,083
Get up, now!

360
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,000
Move!

361
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,750
Let's go! Move!

362
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:44,791
Lights. Parapet.
Base Floods. Turrets. Launch Tunnel.

363
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,666
Comms, you know.

364
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,041
This?

365
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:51,083
Don't touch, that's Alkenzi,
that's the Air Base Link.

366
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,250
You're coming with us.

367
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:53,375
Everyone else stays here.

368
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,583
Your comms have been disabled.

369
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:56,708
Ours are working.

370
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:59,208
If you don't help us,
your family will die.

371
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,291
If you slow us down,
if you stall, if you argue,

372
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,791
if you play us in anyway, they will die.

373
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:06,333
You'll kill us anyway.

374
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:08,333
'Cause that's what you'd do, right?

375
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:09,583
No.

376
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:12,458
If we get what we came for,
everyone walks away.

377
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,166
But if we go down,
you're right there with us.

378
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,791
- 14 minutes.
- Move.

379
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:27,250
Tell me you'll be all right.

380
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:29,958
I'll be fine.

381
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,166
Go.

382
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:49,250
Are you having trouble with your comms?

383
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,000
It just went down.

384
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,833
The Alkenzi line is still open,
but everything else is fried.

385
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:55,916
Weird, right?

386
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,250
Must be the Eye.

387
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,500
Clem out first.

388
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:16,750
Clear.

389
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,375
Vel, take him.

390
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,583
Move.

391
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:20,791
Clem, with me.

392
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,761
- Forty credits.
- I'm in.

393
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:28,791
Deal.

394
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:30,666
Hexba.

395
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,666
Hexa.

396
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,958
Hoxla.

397
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,684
- Come on.
- Oh, come on.

398
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:47,583
Commandant on the floor!

399
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,250
Commandant inspection!

400
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,934
- Muster up! Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

401
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,041
Line it up!

402
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,375
Move!

403
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:57,458
Hands on heads!

404
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:59,041
Hands on your heads!

405
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,208
Drop it! Now!

406
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,142
- Out! Out!
- This is not an inspection,

407
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,583
- it is a robbery!
- Move!

408
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,706
They've taken
the tower and communications.

409
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,958
They're holding hostages,
including my wife and son.

410
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:12,041
Move!

411
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:15,125
They've already killed, and I am sure
that they will do so again,

412
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:18,041
which is why I am urging you to cooperate.

413
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:20,416
Enough! Move! Move!

414
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,125
Hey!

415
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,666
You are gonna load us out
as fast as possible.

416
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,250
Anyone doesn't want to hustle
for the next ten minutes, raise your hand.

417
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:38,291
All right, up! Up! Up! Up! Let's go!

418
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,291
Two men to a trolley. Let's go!

419
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:41,625
You got power?

420
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:43,416
Yeah, I do indeed.

421
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:45,833
Let's go! Move! Move! Move!

422
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,309
I can't unlock the trays.
It takes a signal from Alkenzi.

423
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,601
- Get with the others.
- I only control the gate!

424
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:10,291
- Move!
- They won't open!

425
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:13,416
Do you hear me?
I don't control the vault!

426
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,125
Get ready.

427
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,333
Fire in the hole!

428
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:24,041
They're in.

429
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,541
Go. I'm almost done.
I'll be right behind you.

430
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,458
Let's go!

431
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,833
- Let's go! You, here! Move, move! Move!
- You, up there! Move! You up there!

432
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:45,791
<i>Echo-One. Echo-One,
on spot. Echo-One. Echo-One, on spot.</i>

433
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,250
Valley-One. Loud and clear.

434
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,250
<i>We've taken the vault
and breached the vault door...</i>

435
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:54,791
<i>In... Repeat. We're in...
the freighter now.</i>

436
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,791
<i>Copy that. All good up here.</i>

437
00:28:57,958 --> 00:29:00,250
<i>Get ready.
Alkenzi should be calling in soon.</i>

438
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,625
<i>Will do. Valley-One out.</i>

439
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,291
Come on!

440
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,375
Come on!

441
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,778
- Load!
- Out of the way!

442
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:19,184
- Come on! All the way around!
- Move! Bring it in!

443
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,416
Get it turned around! Move! Move!

444
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,434
You're taking too long!
Let's go! Let's go!

445
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:25,833
- Go! Get out! Out! Out! Okay!
- Come on!

446
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:29,666
- Faster! Get it round and moving!
- Move! Move! Come on, move!

447
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,500
<i>Tower One,
this is Alkenzi Wing Command.</i>

448
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,208
<i>Requesting status rep.</i>

449
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:38,333
<i>We have a vault-breach indicator
lighting up over here.</i>

450
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,833
<i>Tower One, please respond.</i>

451
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,291
<i>A vault-breach indicator light
has gone off, and we need clari...</i>

452
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:17,958
Where are we going?

453
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:19,101
Heading to the vault.

454
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,351
But we'll miss the Eye.

455
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:21,625
Move! Let's go!

456
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:27,750
- Let's go! Move! Move! Move!
- Move!

457
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:30,208
Bring 'em in, bring 'em in. Keep loading!

458
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:32,625
- Come on!
- Now! Now!

459
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:33,958
Move, move, move!

460
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,833
All right! Move! Let's go!

461
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:37,436
- Keep moving!
- Come on!

462
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,771
- Go, go, go!
- Move it!

463
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,888
- Get out of here.
- Keep loadin'!

464
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:46,017
- Let's go!
- Faster!

465
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,750
- Come on.
- Move! Move!

466
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:50,000
- Come on! Faster! Move!
- Move!

467
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,850
- Get loading!
- Get it on. Come on.

468
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,125
Come on!

469
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:08,375
- Move!
- That's it. Let's go!

470
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,041
All right, got it.

471
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,083
Move, move! Move! Move!

472
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,958
Keep moving! Keep moving.

473
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,583
Go! Move around him! Move!

474
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:20,583
Time check!

475
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:22,291
Five-nine.

476
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:24,583
Faster! Faster! Faster!

477
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:26,916
Come on! Let's go! Come on!

478
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:40,916
Watch yourselves!
It's a long way down!

479
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,708
Almost home! Everyone can go home!

480
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:10,958
Let's move!

481
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:12,041
Move!

482
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:13,833
Right, get it out! Out!

483
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:16,708
What are you doing?
You're still loading?

484
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:17,916
We have two minutes.

485
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,215
I was afraid you'd be leaving!

486
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:21,541
We need to be locking up!

487
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,625
Easy there... Yeah...
Quickly, quickly...

488
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You.

489
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,500
Quit gawking and get pushing.

490
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,500
Close it down! Let's go! Last call!

491
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:35,208
You'll hang for this.

492
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:38,875
Seven years serving you?
I deserve worse than that.

493
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,625
Are we good to go?

494
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,708
We're good.

495
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:43,291
Okay, come on! Come on!

496
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,958
Are you crazy?

497
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,166
Just leave it! Get this thing in the air!

498
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,416
What's going on here?

499
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:17,083
You're off your post, Corporal.

500
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:19,333
Sorry, sir, but...

501
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,083
This is a classified mission,
and you're not cleared to be here.

502
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:28,541
Commandant?

503
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:32,833
Tell him, sir. Tell him he needs to leave.

504
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:35,916
Sir?

505
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,833
I am giving you a direct order, Corporal!

506
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,166
What is going on here?

507
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,791
Sir...

508
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,416
- Go and get us ready!
- Cover me!

509
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Now!

510
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:48,583
I'm pinned down!

511
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:50,958
Cover me!

512
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:01,791
No!

513
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:31,416
Where's Taramyn?

514
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:49,666
Get this thing in the air!

515
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,458
Go! Go! Go!

516
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:57,416
Hang on!

517
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,166
- No!
- Nemik!

518
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:26,958
No! No! No!

519
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,541
Lift him!

520
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:33,875
I can't feel my legs. I can't,
I can't feel my legs.

521
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,375
- Nemik.
- Hey.

522
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:37,916
Nemik, can you hear me?

523
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:41,500
Can you hear me?

524
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,583
I need a flight path.

525
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,708
He's hurt! Hold on!

526
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:48,728
- What are you doing?
- Hold him still.

527
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,666
What is that?

528
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,166
- Med-spike. Keep him still.
- Go, go, go.

529
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,250
No.

530
00:36:58,541 --> 00:37:00,708
Where am I heading? I need numbers!

531
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:01,791
Hold on!

532
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,166
I'm flying blind!

533
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Climb!

534
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,875
Climb? Look out the window.

535
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:37,708
Climb. Full climb now!

536
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,875
What did you give him?

537
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,041
I'm pegged here!

538
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,833
I don't have the speed to make it!

539
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:44,625
And now you want me to climb?

540
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,791
Climb!

541
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,500
Dive!

542
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:14,666
Vector six-five-five-five-one.

543
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:16,833
Full boost thrust on level!

544
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:23,583
Come on!

545
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,000
I need to know where we're going.

546
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:23,833
Is he still with us?

547
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:26,875
Yeah, you disappointed?

548
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,625
That's not fair.

549
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:29,851
Where are we heading?

550
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,791
- She wants to bail on him.
- He's dying.

551
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,580
You don't know that.

552
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:38,291
There's a doctor.
We have it built into the contingency.

553
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,291
She doesn't want to
jeopardize the mission.

554
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:42,291
This kid, I mean,

555
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:46,166
this kid is the reason that we are here.

556
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,333
He's alive.

557
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,163
How do we get to the doctor?

558
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:34,958
You think he'll make it?

559
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:37,911
He could get lucky.

560
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:42,458
Yeah, luck.

561
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:47,000
It drives the whole damn galaxy,
doesn't it?

562
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,750
You wanna guess how much is in there?

563
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:05,791
Eighty million, give or take.

564
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:10,708
What'd you tell me?

565
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:13,583
You wanna win and walk away.

566
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:15,958
Well...

567
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,583
forty million apiece.

568
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:24,041
Don't tell me you haven't
thought about it.

569
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:28,958
See, I can't fly the trawler,
but I do have a safe place we can hole up.

570
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:34,708
Between the two of us,
we could be the winners here.

571
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:37,458
So no rebellion for you?

572
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,541
Oh, I'm a rebel. It's just, uh...

573
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,416
me against everybody else.

574
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,541
Where would that put me?

575
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:53,083
Forty million credits is enough
for me to forget all about you.

576
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:57,583
Your brother, with the orchard?

577
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,291
I don't have a brother.

578
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,166
So just leave them here?

579
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,125
Don't play the high mind with me.

580
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,416
You're not here to save
anybody but yourself.

581
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,583
I saw it the first minute
you came into camp.

582
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,458
You're like me, we were born in the hole,

583
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:18,916
all we know is climbing
over somebody else to get out.

584
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:27,291
There's a moon eight parsecs
from here with nobody home.

585
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:32,250
Put that thing down,

586
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:33,666
catch our breath,

587
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:36,666
split up the winnings, and walk...

588
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:57,583
Thank you. Thank you for trying.

589
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:14,083
I did everything I could.

590
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:15,166
It's not you, Doc.

591
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,291
And it's not what you think, either.

592
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,166
Oh, surprise me.

593
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:22,333
I'll give you 30,000 credits
for the ship in the barn.

594
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:23,785
That's twice what it's worth.

595
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:24,833
Excuse me?

596
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:25,916
Where's Skeen?

597
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:29,458
Skeen! Skeen!

598
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:30,541
He's dead.

599
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,291
He wanted to take the money
and leave you here.

600
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:36,666
He wouldn't do that.

601
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:40,666
You're gonna have to think about that.

602
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:42,416
You disgusting bastard.

603
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:44,458
Taramyn warned me.

604
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:47,708
I'm taking my cut.
The number I was promised.

605
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:51,291
I'm leaving you the freighter
and what's inside.

606
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:53,416
I did my job.

607
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:56,291
I'm done.

608
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:59,125
And I wouldn't stick around if I were you.

609
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:02,041
Return this to your friend.

610
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:08,625
Wait.

611
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:13,958
Nemik's manifesto.

612
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:19,583
He said to give this to you.

613
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:21,666
I don't want it.

614
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:23,458
He insisted.

615
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,500
Don't get comfortable.
This is not a meeting.

616
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:56,041
No one is going home.

617
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:58,250
Tell your staff, tell your families.

618
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:03,166
I want every Star Sector
and Planetary Emergency Retaliation plan

619
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:06,541
in the building ready
for presentation by midnight.

620
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:09,666
Senator Dhow's proposal
is both temperate and timely,

621
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,416
far more reasoned and thoughtful
than the calls for decree

622
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,125
we've been hearing from the other side.

623
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:19,625
There will be a fact-finding commission
put in place this session,

624
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:22,250
and it will prove

625
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:27,625
that this is a boot to the throats
of all Ghormans,

626
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:31,500
who've done nothing more than
request their basic rights.

627
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:36,000
My bill assails the coarse
and blatant domination

628
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:38,375
of a peaceful and faithful ally.

629
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:49,791
<i>The blue is lovely.</i>

630
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,125
It's a Devaron blue.

631
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:55,291
There's an inscription on that one.

632
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,083
In a language no one remembers.

633
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:01,166
How sad.

634
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:05,333
No, it's liberating.
You decide what it says.

635
00:46:06,291 --> 00:46:07,750
Your own secret language.

636
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,708
Got anything from Aldhani?

637
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:13,458
Excuse me?

638
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:14,791
Aldhani.

639
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:18,958
Big rebel attack last night.
It's all the news.

640
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:22,916
I'll have to look.

641
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:26,333
Maybe we have something in the back.

642
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,500
Really? I was kidding.
