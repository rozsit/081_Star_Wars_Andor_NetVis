1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,096
You need a radical
insurgency you can count on.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,620
You need ghorman rebels you
can depend on to do the wrong thing.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,476
<i>We're safe here.</i>

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,226
<i>Then why are we being so paranoid?</i>

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,726
- Just trying to protect us.
- You mean me?

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,426
<i>You're being cast aside.</i>

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,426
<i>You're being discarded
and too naive to see it.</i>

8
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,306
<i>I'm in charge here, mother.</i>

9
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,846
<i>This is the bureau of
standards field office in ghorman.</i>

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,806
You were here. I'd fixed
it. You'd made it back.

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,056
<i>You'd found a woman actually
willing to make a life with you,</i>

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,886
<i>and you just walk away?</i>

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,926
Such a pleasure to finally meet you.

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,410
Finally indeed.

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,500
- I'm not buying another spider.
- This one's free.

16
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,056
You're right. You're not a tourist.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,806
<i>Perhaps you wish to know
more about where you live.</i>

18
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,346
<i>They made contact. I've
been invited to a meeting.</i>

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,516
- A meeting with who?
- I don't know.

20
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,016
<i>It's public. It's a town hall.</i>

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,846
<i>But this is them. It's
ghorman front. I know it.</i>

22
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,290
<i>Mark my words!</i>

23
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,016
<i>We're drowning in rumors.</i>

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,386
Many people are starting to think

25
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,976
this new building is
more than just an annex.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,556
I'm not sure why the empire would
build an armory in the middle of palmo,

27
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,386
but I'm running out of answers.

28
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,516
Carro rylanz. He's
running the ghorman front.

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,516
I need an assessment.
I'm not sure about the group.

30
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,580
And bix?

31
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,950
<i>No. You'd have to go alone.</i>

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,926
Think of it, comrades. Fuel on demand.

33
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,596
All the rhydo that you can steal.

34
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,976
Not many old pipe-poachers out there.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,660
Not many who've lived to tell the tale.

36
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,556
Which variation?

37
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,676
You'll teach them all.

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,266
But I need to leave tomorrow.

39
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,540
There was an agreement.
This was negotiated.

40
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,120
You're here till I get what I need.

41
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,160
<i>Ryloth 7-4-8.</i>

42
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,080
<i>Maybe you'll find a husband and I'll.</i>

43
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,056
<i>I basically hold him in that room
and say, "all right. Stay there."</i>

44
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,016
{\an8}"Stay <i>In that corner forever." Yeah?</i>

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,660
{\an8}Corell <i>ia 2-2-2.</i>

46
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,176
<i>Ryloth 7-4-8.</i>

47
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,700
<i>I feel like ever since we moved in here...</i>

48
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,370
<i>Really uncomfortable, if I grabbed...</i>

49
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,976
<i>Sculdun 3-4-3.</i>

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,450
- <i>We're not to be interrupted.
- Yes, sir.</i>

51
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,330
<i>Well?</i>

52
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,516
<i>It's a forgery.</i>

53
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,766
<i>- It's a good one, but...
- It should be.</i>

54
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,346
<i>It certainly cost enough.</i>

55
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,620
<i>I won't tell you what I paid for it.</i>

56
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,290
<i>Unfortunately, the
dealer... you're up early.</i>

57
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,580
Anything urgent?

58
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,370
Not yet.

59
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,870
And our friend's on his way?

60
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,500
Stop.

61
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,870
Someone here!

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,516
Can I help you?

63
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,540
Ghorman?

64
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,000
Visiting friends?

65
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,620
Why do you ask?

66
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,330
I'm curious by nature.

67
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,540
I have friends everywhere.

68
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,870
Bon!

69
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,660
What do we have for ghorman?

70
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,886
<i>Your name is varian Skye.</i>

71
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,386
<i>You were born in tahini</i>

72
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,556
<i>and moved to Coruscant with
your brother when you were 12.</i>

73
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,476
<i>Your brother, patrio,
soon returned home,</i>

74
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,676
<i>but you'd found an apprenticeship
in a dressmaking studio</i>

75
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,266
<i>and decided to stay.</i>

76
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,386
<i>After your apprenticeship,
you moved to the fashion district</i>

77
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,596
<i>where you found work as
an assistant to a designer.</i>

78
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,160
<i>Just wanted to let you know
I'm coming home this weekend.</i>

79
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,476
<i>What a pleasant surprise!</i>

80
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,226
I'm just worried if I don't
come now, it might be a while.

81
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,096
There's a rumor they might be

82
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,840
tightening up the travel restrictions here.

83
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,226
<i>I thought you were in charge.</i>

84
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,676
<i>This is hardly a bureau
of standards issue.</i>

85
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,806
<i>I hope someone who knows
what they're doing is watching out.</i>

86
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,886
<i>For what?</i>

87
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,040
<i>Your safety.</i>

88
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,096
<i>Well, they're definitely watching out.</i>

89
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,700
What they're looking for is a mystery.

90
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,426
There's not much in
the way of danger here.

91
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,330
- <i>When would you arrive?
- Hang on.</i>

92
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,580
- I gotta go, mother, I'll let you know.
- Wait

93
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,636
listen up!

94
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,096
I need everybody to step
away from their workstations

95
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,160
<i>and leave the room immediately.</i>

96
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,000
What's going on here?

97
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,636
They're telling us all to leave.

98
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,056
No, stay where you are.

99
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,290
Syril karn?

100
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,136
Yes?

101
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,306
I'm attendant grymish from isb tech.

102
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,136
We have reason to believe there
are listening devices in this office.

103
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,516
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

104
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,016
We need everyone out immediately.

105
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,766
I'm afraid you'll have to wait.
We're in the middle of an audit.

106
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,056
What you're in the middle
of, sir, is an isb tech sweep.

107
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,476
Everyone in here will be in
custody until we finish our evaluation.

108
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,700
What do you mean "custody?"

109
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,830
On whose authority? This is my office.

110
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,476
Are you refusing a direct imperial order?

111
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,950
This is insane.

112
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,950
Take him.

113
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,500
Are you... come...
everybody... everybody out!

114
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,290
- Calling headquarters!
- Yeah, good luck with that.

115
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,250
Anyone else wanna argue?

116
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,250
<i>Sculdun 3-4-3.</i>

117
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,250
- <i>We're not to be interrupted.
- Yes, sir.</i>

118
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,910
<i>Well?</i>

119
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,766
<i>It's a forgery.</i>

120
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,266
<i>It's a good one, but</i>

121
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,830
<i>it should be. It certainly cost enough.</i>

122
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,500
I won't tell you what I paid for it.

123
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,540
Unfortunately, the dealer
I bought it from is dead.

124
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,290
He's lucky he's dead.

125
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,476
Well, he may have been
fooled as much as we were.

126
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,330
<i>As of this moment, everything
in the room is under suspicion.</i>

127
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,330
What else have we missed?

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,500
Even the finest collections
have problems now and then.

129
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,306
One problem is too many. I want
everything vetted once and for all.

130
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,266
- <i>Everything?
- Everything!</i>

131
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,330
- <i>We have the exhibition...
- all of it!</i>

132
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,386
<i>- I want it inspected and re-certified.
- Everything!</i>

133
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,370
<i>You... get...</i>

134
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,250
<i>This is your first trip to ghorman.</i>

135
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,950
<i>As a fashion designer,
it's a rite of passage.</i>

136
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,410
<i>You've lived in the same
place for the last five years.</i>

137
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,000
<i>51457, level 4888,
east narcene, Coruscant.</i>

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,726
<i>51457, level 4888,
east narcene, Coruscant.</i>

139
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,556
<i>It's a small unit, but it's
above your design studio</i>

140
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,040
<i>where you do most of your work.</i>

141
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,370
There was a...

142
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,500
Listening device...

143
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,750
In my office.

144
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,540
How long it's been there, or if
it's even operational are unknown.

145
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,160
You will all now have the
pleasure of thorough isb interview,

146
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,620
and there will be new security
measures going forward.

147
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,830
Because, of course...

148
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,200
We're bugging our own office!

149
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Hello.

150
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,870
- We were worried.
- You seem upset.

151
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,660
We saw isb come into the building.

152
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,846
Yes. Yes, I am... upset.

153
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,580
They tore my office apart.

154
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,056
I was interrogated for
two hours like a criminal.

155
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,806
For coming to the meeting?

156
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,950
No... no, no. It's nothing
to do with that. They were...

157
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,040
They were looking
for a listening device...

158
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,096
Which, of course, I either
condoned or ignored,

159
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,676
or put in myself for some reason.

160
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,676
Or else the whole thing was a
ruse for them to put something in.

161
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,676
I don't know. They...
They do what they want.

162
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,250
- Without explanation?
- It's the isb.

163
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,450
They have their own
rules. No one else matters.

164
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,040
A lesson for all of us.

165
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,096
It's humiliating.

166
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,886
I take my work seriously.

167
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,556
It's outrageous.

168
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,250
Many of us believe the emperor has
no idea what's being done on his behalf.

169
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,250
We think the isb is running
a shadow government.

170
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,200
To be honest, nothing would
surprise me at this point.

171
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,910
And believe me, you
don't know the half of it.

172
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,790
What if we could help the
empire by working together?

173
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,250
How would we do that?

174
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,620
We need to know
what's on those carriers.

175
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,556
You know who we are and
you see what's happening here.

176
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,056
We need to know what kind of facility
it is before things get out of hand.

177
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,476
I told you. I don't have plans.

178
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,346
We want to focus on deliveries.

179
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,266
We need to know what's
on those transports, syril.

180
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,790
It's... construction material.

181
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,516
That's what comes across my desk.

182
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,250
- And the rest of it?
- Not every transport has a bill of lading.

183
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,080
Those are the ones we'd be interested in.

184
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,676
No.

185
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,500
No, no. Not that.

186
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,000
He's fine. He'll be home soon enough.

187
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,660
I came to see about you.

188
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,700
Here I am.

189
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,500
This old place.

190
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,910
Not many safe houses have a view.

191
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,290
- You want a drink?
- No, I can't stay that long.

192
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,080
This isn't fun, is it?

193
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,620
The nights are fun.

194
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,806
I've slept here twice.

195
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,080
Not in a very long time, but... For fun?

196
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,080
No. False alarm.

197
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,660
Never ends, does it?

198
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,096
All the hiding.

199
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,450
It will. We'll bring them
down, or die trying.

200
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,750
What else is there?

201
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,766
I'm not as strong as you.

202
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,080
That's just tonight talking.

203
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,410
That's being stuck here in this box.

204
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,290
Or maybe you're not as strong as I think.

205
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,870
Maybe not.

206
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,766
I'll try to find someplace else
for you to stay. I'll have a look.

207
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,806
I'm not loving Coruscant.

208
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,540
It's overwhelming. I know you...

209
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,450
You've been struggling.

210
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,000
Is that what he told you?

211
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,386
I'm better than he thinks I am.

212
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,540
All he does is sing your praises.

213
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,540
We need you, bix. We need you healthy.

214
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,160
You came here to offer me something.

215
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,370
You wanted something.

216
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,830
And you changed your mind.

217
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,120
Not lost your eye, have you? It
was just another weapons appraisal.

218
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,660
I have alternatives. We'll
find something more exciting.

219
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,766
You should rest. You should
be here when he gets back.

220
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,870
Give it.

221
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,040
I use it for sleep.

222
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,660
It works for a while.

223
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,910
But the dreams come
back worse when you stop.

224
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,870
Be careful.

225
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,290
You need me healthy.

226
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,370
Yeah.

227
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,450
Variation five... So that's thirds...

228
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,080
Watch the line.

229
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,450
Take your time.

230
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,200
Be sure.

231
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,870
Careful.

232
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,000
One to the right.

233
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,450
And we're all dead.

234
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,660
We're doing station five, right?

235
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,806
Well, if you close the pipe completely,

236
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,056
- it'll spark when it comes back on.
- I knew that. I knew that. I'm an idiot.

237
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,556
It's right here.

238
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,056
Well, it's a lot to take in.

239
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,846
It doesn't seem to bother you.

240
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,596
Eight variations. Saw thinks there's
eight things I have to remember.

241
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,136
He doesn't realize all the primes,
all the sifting factors, the tools...

242
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,790
How did you ever learn
this? Who taught you?

243
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,056
No more questions. Sorry.

244
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,120
I can't leave until you get this.

245
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,830
Come on.

246
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,540
Mid sift, variation two.

247
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,660
- What time's your flight?
- I'll make it.

248
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,306
I'm just backing up all
our transport schedules.

249
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,016
I'd hate to think what would happen
if those isb idiots hit the wrong button.

250
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,306
- We can do that for you.
- Just get the audit back on track.

251
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,620
Make sure to lock up tight.

252
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,410
I don't want any more security questions.

253
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,540
Yes, sir.

254
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,540
Traveling, are we?
Something to take home?

255
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,226
Yeah, I'll take one for my mother.

256
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,700
Well, you'll want a good one.

257
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,410
We're fine. Nobody's watching.

258
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,000
Man of taste. Best spider
on the Plaza. Come back safe.

259
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,540
Thank you.

260
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,410
Yes...

261
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,700
Thank you.

262
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,200
We were wondering if we should offer it
up to sculdun as a gift for the exhibition.

263
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,476
It's short notice but
if there was interest,

264
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,136
we might find time for
an immediate installation.

265
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,386
It's remarkable, yes,

266
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,540
but, um, between us? I wouldn't do it.

267
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,426
There's been some question about
the provenance of a certain piece

268
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,596
nothing to do with luthen,

269
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,476
but sculdun is in a rage about it

270
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,266
and they are taking
everything out of there

271
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,540
the day after the party for re-appraisal.

272
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,750
{\an8}"Military security required."

273
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,750
Thank you.

274
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Checking in?

275
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,750
Varian Skye.

276
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,766
Holo-screen, air flow and window blinds,

277
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,976
they all work through the
single console on the nightstand.

278
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,450
Is that where it happened?

279
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,040
The monument?

280
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,830
It is.

281
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,596
Really?

282
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,620
Wow. Right there.

283
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,806
Some people don't think it's a good idea

284
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,370
to commemorate a
massacre in the center of town.

285
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,386
- Is that you?
- Do I mind?

286
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,886
Yeah.

287
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,846
No. Doesn't matter to me.

288
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,580
I'm sure you have an opinion.

289
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,910
I needn't be reminded. I was there.

290
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,950
How old were you?

291
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,500
Twelve.

292
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,620
Grand moff tarkin, right?

293
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,250
Will there be anything else, sir?

294
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

295
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,540
Didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.

296
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,250
Here, thank you.

297
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,200
We've been asked not
to speak of it with guests.

298
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,330
I'm just a designer.

299
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,750
I'm curious.

300
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,330
I've been hearing about
ghorman my whole life.

301
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,830
It was moff tarkin.

302
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,870
People wouldn't clear
and he wanted to land...

303
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,620
And more of us kept coming.

304
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,330
We thought there
was safety in numbers.

305
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,516
Who would land a cruiser on a crowd

306
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,410
full of unarmed citizens?

307
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,290
I was with my father.

308
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,750
He was killed saving me.

309
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,450
Sorry to hear that.

310
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,950
Haven't gone very far, have I?

311
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,620
My wife thinks it's insane we stay here.

312
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,080
Do let me know if there's
anything else you might need.

313
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,290
Hey.

314
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,700
Thank you.

315
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,830
It's good to meet you.

316
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,040
I was safe.

317
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,426
I was careful all the way.

318
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,950
I know. I had you followed.

319
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,080
Partagaz insisted.

320
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,226
- How long can I stay?
- An hour.

321
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,580
Are you kidding?

322
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,596
Do you think they're really
watching eedy's apartment?

323
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,516
No. But we've put too much in now

324
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,700
to have it go wrong
for something so small.

325
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,500
An hour.

326
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,370
Turn out the lights.

327
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,410
Can't believe you had me followed.

328
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,540
Turn out the lights.

329
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,580
Varian Skye?

330
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,766
Yes.

331
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,516
- Enza. The house of rylanz.
- Enza!

332
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,056
You've just arrived.

333
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,766
Yeah. Yeah.

334
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,386
Already out and about? How intrepid.

335
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:20,136
And you... how observant.

336
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,290
Well, the times demand
it, don't you think?

337
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,266
I was planning to make
an appointment tomorrow

338
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,830
and here you are.

339
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,096
- May I?
- Yes, please.

340
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,410
How timely.

341
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,500
You're a designer?

342
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Trying.

343
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,516
This cafe used to be full of designers...

344
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,176
And weavers and buyers.

345
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,750
People fought for tables.

346
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,910
Look at us now.

347
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,290
Is your hotel even half full?

348
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,636
I just checked in.

349
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,870
I happen to know it's not.

350
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,830
What is it you think you're doing?

351
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,290
You don't know me.

352
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,040
Let's start over.

353
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,450
My friend suggested I meet your father.

354
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,830
Your friend might have come himself.

355
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,790
Unless, I'm the friend, right?

356
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,250
Or maybe I'm a snitch,

357
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,370
and you're my payday.

358
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,870
Maybe I'm isb.

359
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,040
Maybe you just put everyone
you care about into a cell.

360
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,096
I am who you want me to be,

361
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,410
but that's just you getting lucky.

362
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,950
People die rushing.

363
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,120
You have no idea who I am.

364
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,870
You need to be more careful.

365
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,950
It's hard to be patient when
your world is falling apart.

366
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,950
My father's very proud.

367
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,330
And I can't wait to meet him.

368
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,450
I need fabric.

369
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,540
When is a good time for me to
come by the showroom tomorrow?

370
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,700
I'll, send word in the morning.

371
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,620
Thanks for stopping by.

372
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,636
Hey, the people you have following
me, they're just drawing attention.

373
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,700
Send them home.

374
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,250
Nice to meet you.

375
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,620
Open.

376
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,910
Does it have a name?

377
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,886
It's your spider.

378
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,080
Perhaps I'll call it "syril."

379
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,426
That's an interesting choice.

380
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,596
What a comfort that will be.

381
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,330
The silence.

382
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,540
The brooding.

383
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,040
The disregard for common sense.

384
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,000
Be almost like having you here.

385
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,636
<i>Welcome back to good
morning, Coruscant!</i>

386
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,726
<i>It's that time of the year, toffi!</i>

387
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,596
<i>Senate investiture. I
absolutely adore this holiday.</i>

388
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,386
<i>I know you wanna talk
about the politics of it all.</i>

389
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,226
<i>- I do.
- I want to talk parties.</i>

390
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,386
<i>- Political parties?
- No!</i>

391
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,266
<i>It's vesty week!</i>

392
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,346
<i>I wanna know who's
going where with who.</i>

393
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:42,386
<i>I wanna talk clothes. I wanna
know where you've been invited.</i>

394
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,766
<i>You are the one on
everybody's gala guest list.</i>

395
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,016
<i>And the must-have accessories!</i>

396
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,306
<i>Why don't you tell everyone
where you're going on the big night?</i>

397
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,636
<i>Come on, you know I don't
pick favorites. The imperial ball.</i>

398
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,176
<i>- Toffi!
- Well, it's true.</i>

399
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,266
<i>That's why you, dear viewers,
will be getting the inside story</i>

400
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,886
<i>from the hottest ticket in town.</i>

401
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,886
<i>Don't say she doesn't give you anything.</i>

402
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,830
<i>The time of selflessness.</i>

403
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,120
Welcome to the house of rylanz.

404
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,540
My pleasure.

405
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,870
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

406
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,540
Please.

407
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,500
Varian Skye.

408
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,540
Carro rylanz. Welcome to ghorman.

409
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,426
I've waited far too long in
coming. Your showroom is fantastic.

410
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,080
Nineteen generations.

411
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,660
One of the youngest twilleries in palmo.

412
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,426
Amazing. Amazing.

413
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,516
Our webberie estates are quite far away,

414
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,846
but they are certainly worth
a visit if you find the time.

415
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,870
Can I show you?

416
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,250
I've been told about your
conversation last night.

417
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,410
Apparently, we have a lot to learn.

418
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,056
Is it safe to talk in here?

419
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,500
We sweep for listening devices daily.

420
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,266
That must draw attention.

421
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:53,160
Every twillery on the Plaza does
the same. It's a competitive market.

422
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,766
There was a rebel pilot
trapped in the mountains.

423
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,790
We saved him.

424
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,870
You were given a special radio.

425
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,500
The person that sent
you is but a voice to me.

426
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,476
We've spoken, we've
exchanged messages,

427
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,676
but I have no idea, really,
who's at the other end of the line.

428
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,540
That won't change. But
it's for everyone's benefit.

429
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,660
I do have this.

430
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:24,160
It's a fresh code-crystal for the radio.

431
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,580
It's one-of-a-kind.

432
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,540
It will only fit the
transmitter you were given.

433
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,750
I offer that as a bond.

434
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,516
The new imperial
building. You've seen it?

435
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,176
Well, it's hard to miss.

436
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,096
- They're building an armory.
- In the center of town?

437
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,806
We don't know why. They deny it.

438
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,080
It's in violation of the imperial charter.

439
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:57,476
We've had sightings. We've slipped
people into some of the work crews,

440
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,040
but we were unsure until now.

441
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,500
I'm only meeting you because we
find ourselves with a unique opportunity.

442
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,790
We have a source inside.

443
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,790
- An imperial source?
- I'll not say.

444
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,700
Feeding false
information is what they do.

445
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,176
You're aware of that?

446
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,846
They're... they're pretty good at it.

447
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,370
The information is reliable.

448
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,056
Shipments come by
cargo-carrier from the south depot

449
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,476
at night through the city.

450
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,886
We've been tracking
the routes and schedules.

451
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,200
Now we know which transports to target.

452
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,266
The ones you think have weapons.

453
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,830
We know what they are
doing. Now we need proof.

454
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,976
What do you mean by "target"?

455
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,886
Take it. Take it down.

456
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,306
We need to catch them in their lie.

457
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,830
We need to let the people of
ghorman know the undeniable truth.

458
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,846
What about the weapons?

459
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,306
We start our own armory.

460
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,000
Ever done anything like this before?

461
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,080
Steal?

462
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,846
It's a military transport.
It won't be easy.

463
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,450
Quiet, both of you.

464
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,370
Tactical expertise is not our strong suit.

465
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,330
We need an advisor.

466
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,120
I'm gonna need some
swatches sent over.

467
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,910
You're gonna want to check the radio.

468
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,676
And, if everything is fine,

469
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,330
I would love to get a
tour of palmo by night.

470
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,450
- You can call for me at the hotel.
- As you wish.

471
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,620
Thank you.

472
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,976
You're convinced we're connecting
to the ghorman front leadership?

473
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,056
I am, sir.

474
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,056
Carro rylanz is a prominent
businessman and politician in palmo.

475
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,096
I've been dealing with him directly.

476
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,760
And we're sure they're buying this story?

477
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,620
We're skeptically confident, sir.

478
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,910
Words to live by.

479
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,950
I think they're planning already.

480
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,500
They're inexperienced but very eager.

481
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,370
How often those attributes align.

482
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,080
They'll need help, sir.

483
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:29,346
The plan... your plan to bait
ghorman as a prize for outside agitators

484
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,750
needs to begin somewhere.

485
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,120
This could be that moment.

486
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,870
How may we assist?

487
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,096
Transport schedules
need to remain consistent.

488
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,636
The information I pass
them needs to be accurate.

489
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,016
I'll need oversight on military security.

490
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,766
- Done.
- If they pull it off,

491
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,910
when it's over, we need to
calibrate retribution carefully.

492
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,886
We want them growing bolder.

493
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,476
They need to see what winning feels like.

494
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,750
I'll make sure things
don't get out of hand.

495
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,330
Excellent work, syril.

496
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,790
Thank you, sir.

497
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,290
We'll keep you briefed.

498
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,500
If I say this is the
greatest day of my life...

499
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,040
Does it spoil everything?

500
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,910
It's good to see you happy.

501
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,250
I know all the variations, in
theory. I just need more practice.

502
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,620
So we can lose the boy?

503
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,700
He's seen too much.

504
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,500
If you're ready, then I'll get rid of him.

505
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,596
He's a good engineer.
A great one, maybe.

506
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,910
- But we have you!
- What about the people who sent him?

507
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,660
Accidents happen.

508
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,870
I was hoping he could come along.

509
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,830
You lack confidence, pluti.

510
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,910
Until you tell me the station we're
hitting, this is gonna be on edge.

511
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,450
The number of variations I'm
carrying right now is driving me crazy.

512
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,160
If I could focus on one
single variation, one,

513
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,500
I'd have the confidence
you're looking for.

514
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,080
Markez moon. Neen valley.

515
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,040
Station four junction.

516
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,910
We leave tomorrow night.

517
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,330
Tubes has all of the pipe numbers.

518
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Thank you.

519
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Wilmon?

520
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,750
We'll keep him for now.

521
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,750
The tinian codex in
sculdun's office collection.

522
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,620
What about it?

523
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,330
What have you heard?

524
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,596
I need some good news.

525
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,750
You'll have to wait on that.

526
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,000
There's another piece.

527
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,370
The coryio chalice.
Apparently, it's a forgery.

528
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,950
They're going to examine
everything in the collection.

529
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,500
They'll find our microphone.

530
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,700
You heard this on the bug?

531
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,250
They're taking everything
out the day after the party.

532
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,346
They never send more
than three at a time.

533
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,910
The ones we're interested
in always travel alone.

534
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,500
Thirty meters down, we
have a transport waiting.

535
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,330
We slide the cargo to
the bottom and disappear.

536
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,660
- Let's keep making avoidable mistakes.
- Let's keep overreacting.

537
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,346
I wouldn't be so upset
if I hadn't predicted it!

538
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,806
This solves nothing.

539
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,596
- And for what? What have we ever heard?
- Are you done?

540
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,636
"Let's put a bug in davo sculdun's
office that leads directly back to us."

541
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,346
It didn't seem to bother you
when we caught yularen lying.

542
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,476
- Seriously.
- The holo-news buyout.

543
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,136
Sculdun courting the grand vizier!

544
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,226
Bits and pieces. That's all we ever got.

545
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:03,176
- Two years of bits and pieces!
- You agreed to it!

546
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,976
- I let you talk me into it!
- You're becoming insufferable!

547
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,450
I can't keep track anymore!

548
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,766
All these lines we've
laid. All this information.

549
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,386
The radios, the frequencies,
the messages flying around!

550
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,870
We're drowning.

551
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,516
And you keep pretending
it's all under control.

552
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,750
Are you done?

553
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,200
We have to take it out at the party.

554
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,290
And if we can't?

555
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,700
We should be prepared.

556
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,870
- Is he ready?
- Yes.

557
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,540
Ready enough to do it on
his own? No help from you?

558
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,700
I think so.

559
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,450
You think

560
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,450
or you know?

561
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,580
It's "neither." I've done what I can.

562
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,500
I've done everything you've asked for.

563
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,160
And if I don't show up back home, there

564
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,476
traitor!

565
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,250
- What happened?
- He's a traitor.

566
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,700
Show them!

567
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,516
He's been transmitting to the empire.

568
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,540
What?

569
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,290
There's an ambush waiting for
us at the markez moon pipeline.

570
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:00,306
But we... We will be many parsecs away

571
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:03,976
drinking our rhydo in peace.

572
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,160
Move quickly, comrades.
Whatever you don't take, we burn.

573
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,540
We will not be back this way again.

574
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,870
It's on you, boy.

575
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,620
So...

576
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,476
Are you running away or
running to find us reinforcements?

577
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,016
That won't be up to me.

578
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,950
Surely you have an opinion.

579
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,726
Hijacking the carrier?

580
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,540
Yes, can be done.

581
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,766
But can you and your people do it alone?

582
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,386
I don't think so.

583
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,000
How much help do we need?

584
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,636
It's not stealing things that's difficult.

585
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,096
It's getting away.

586
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,620
But you won't be doing that.

587
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,846
You'll be living at the scene of the crime.

588
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:49,580
Worse than that... You're planning
to advertise what you've done.

589
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,750
So then what?

590
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,160
Let it continue?

591
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,500
Let them build what they want?

592
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,040
Let them persecute us for no reason

593
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,636
and tighten the noose
every time we cry out?

594
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,910
Is that what you suggest?

595
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,266
Is that truly your recommendation?

596
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,120
I have more questions
than recommendations.

597
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,830
Not much of a revolutionary, are you?

598
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,040
Perhaps not.

599
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:30,580
Good day to you.

600
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,870
And tell your friend I'm not impressed.

601
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,556
I was younger than you are now.

602
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:25,000
I was a prisoner.

603
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,200
They made a work camp in the jungle.

604
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:34,910
No droids, no beasts,
just men and cargo.

605
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:38,660
Onderon jungle.

606
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,226
Real jungle.

607
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,846
Hot, wet, blistering jungle.

608
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:46,370
Old men died fast.

609
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,120
Just dropped where they stood.

610
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,096
We came back the next day,

611
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,750
there'd be nothing but a bone
or two where they went down.

612
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,910
Our clothes, just... just melted away.

613
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,200
So they worked us naked.

614
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,040
Two, three hundred men.

615
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:10,950
Boys, really.

616
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,750
Back and forth until the only thing
you could remember was back and forth.

617
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:20,950
Then one day, everyone started to itch.

618
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,766
Everyone, all at once.

619
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:28,540
Even the guards.

620
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,830
You could feel your skin coming alive.

621
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,830
It was the rhydo.

622
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,500
They had a leak.

623
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,250
You could feel it
before you could smell it.

624
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,790
So they all panicked and ran away...

625
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,500
But it was new to me.

626
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,000
It's done.

627
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,700
I'm gonna open the valve now.

628
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,620
I have always loved you.

629
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,750
What are you doing?

630
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,790
- There it is.
- How can you do that?

631
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,910
Because I understand it.

632
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,000
Because she's my sister
rhydo, and she loves me!

633
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,540
That itch, that burn...

634
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,370
You feel how badly
she wants to explode?

635
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,700
Remember this.
Remember this moment!

636
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,910
This perfect night.

637
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,306
You think I'm crazy?

638
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,660
Yes, I am.

639
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,120
Revolution is not for the sane.

640
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,160
Look at us.

641
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:02,870
Unloved.

642
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,500
Hunted.

643
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,700
Cannon fodder.

644
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,016
We'll all be dead before
the republic is back

645
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,160
and yet... here we are.

646
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,290
Where are you, boy?

647
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,726
You're here! You're not
with luthen. You're here!

648
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,950
You're right here, and
you're ready to fight!

649
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:38,750
We're the rhydo, kid. We're the fuel.

650
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:42,620
We're the thing that explodes when
there's too much friction in the air.

651
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:52,080
Let it in, boy! That's freedom calling!

652
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,556
Let it in. Let it run!

653
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:00,200
Let it run wild!
