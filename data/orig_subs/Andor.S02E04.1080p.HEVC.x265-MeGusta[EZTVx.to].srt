1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,846
The restraints are nothing to be feared.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,370
It's much safer for you to
be tethered as we engage.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,910
<i>It doesn't take long.</i>

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,040
It won't feel that way to you.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,386
No!

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,136
- No! No!
- Bix. Wake up.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,700
You're okay. You're okay...

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,870
<i>You're fine. You're safe.</i>

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,136
Spiders are not the most
unique thing in ghorman.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,426
There's a mineral underground. Doctor!

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,096
Deep substrate foliated kalkite.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,926
The kalkite extraction, I'm
assuming it's an invasive process.

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,636
The extent of our withdrawal
may render the planet unstable.

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,016
There is a risk of... total collapse.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,266
We don't have a large presence
on ghorman at the moment.

16
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,540
He's planned for that.

17
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,750
We're building a new armory in palmo.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,426
Excuse me?

19
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,830
We're starting tomorrow.

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,426
Propaganda will only get you so far.

21
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,056
You need a radical
insurgency you can count on.

22
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,386
You need ghorman rebels you
can depend on to do the wrong thing.

23
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,846
- Did krennic offer you the job?
- You know that he did.

24
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,290
Then it's done. We're in it.

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,886
Ghorman will be yours
to run as you wish.

26
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,136
You'll only answer to krennic and
he's got no time for anything but results.

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,950
There are no small jobs here
at the bureau of standards.

28
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,096
You may hear that and
wonder how it can be true.

29
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,766
But... not that long ago, I was
standing right where you are now.

30
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,250
Syril, dedra was just telling
me how well you're doing here.

31
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,806
Was she?

32
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,056
And I told her that came
as no surprise to me.

33
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,910
No sign of your husband?

34
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,290
He'll be back.

35
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,250
There you are.

36
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,000
He told me everything.

37
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,450
I know you wanted him to live, but
cassian said he'd seen your faces, so...

38
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,950
You tried.

39
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,790
He knows that.

40
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,540
Wherever he is.

41
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,000
Wasn't much of a soldier, was he?

42
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,290
They'll never find his body.

43
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,226
His family will never
know what happened.

44
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,580
I

45
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,870
I forgot to ask his name.

46
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,040
Might be a bit late now.

47
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,910
Everyone has their own rebellion.

48
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Right?

49
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,540
Breathe. Breathe.

50
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,330
Same thing again? Dr. Gorst?

51
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,620
- You wanna talk about it?
- Just go back to bed.

52
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,580
It's been a while now.

53
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,080
It's being home. Here.
Whatever this place is.

54
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,910
It's when I relax.

55
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,410
We still need to do something
about these windows.

56
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,266
Yeah. We can do that tomorrow.

57
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,660
Get some decent plates.

58
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,290
And towels.

59
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,886
If we're gonna keep coming back,

60
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,500
- we might as well settle in.
- Hey. Hey.

61
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
You sure you don't wanna talk about it?

62
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,160
Bix.

63
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,726
I can barely see you.

64
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,950
Turn it.

65
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,290
<i>Mother?</i>

66
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,266
<i>- The other way?
- It's the connection.</i>

67
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,346
The other way.

68
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,346
You might as well be in the outer rim.

69
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,740
- I'm seeing you clearly.
- How nice for you.

70
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,750
There. There, you had it.

71
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,750
- Don't worry about me.
- I'll try to remember what you look like.

72
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,080
- It's an imperial signal.
- It should be fine.

73
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,556
Where are you?

74
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,096
I am in my office.

75
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,976
Requesting a transfer, I hope.

76
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,346
I like it here.

77
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,096
I think you've got spiders in your brain.

78
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,346
<i>Or whatever those things
are called. The web weavers?</i>

79
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,226
Ghorlectipods.

80
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,556
- Good morning, sir.
- The thought of it.

81
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,016
<i>No one understands
what you're doing out there.</i>

82
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,636
And when you say "no one," I'm
assuming you mean uncle harlo?

83
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,136
He says you're deluded if you
think ghorman was a promotion.

84
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,226
His advice is always uplifting.

85
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,766
You're being cast aside.

86
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,346
<i>You're being discarded
and too naive to see it.</i>

87
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,636
- Morning.
- I'm in charge here, mother.

88
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,016
They've put you on the shelf,
syril. You've been played.

89
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,676
You, of all people, should understand

90
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,386
<i>the attraction of being in charge.</i>

91
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,676
- In charge? Of what?
- Counting spiders?

92
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,846
<i>Let's not forget your last
foray into the provinces.</i>

93
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,556
This is the bureau of
standards field office in ghorman.

94
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,726
It's hardly the provinces.

95
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,596
What it is, hardly, is Coruscant.

96
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,080
You were here.

97
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,830
I'd fixed it. You'd made it back.

98
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,766
People die trying for a
desk at headquarters.

99
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,806
<i>And then they die at those desks.</i>

100
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,096
You were here, syril.

101
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,426
You'd found a woman actually
willing to make a life with you,

102
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,386
<i>and you just walk away?</i>

103
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,556
<i>A respectable career,
a relationship, finally?</i>

104
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,556
<i>All of it cast aside,
thrown away, and for what?</i>

105
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,136
A field office on ghorman?

106
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,636
- I'm assuming you won't be visiting.
- They won't get another credit of mine.

107
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,016
<i>I'm not buying ghorman again.</i>

108
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,386
<i>I'm sick of it.</i>

109
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,766
<i>They were always too
good for the rest of us.</i>

110
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,886
You are watching too
much imperial news.

111
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,870
<i>My opinions were well-established
before you relocated.</i>

112
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,410
These are decent people.

113
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,306
Syril, I have met some
ghormans in my time.

114
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,176
<i>Uncle harlo used to wear
nothing but ghorman twill.</i>

115
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,926
<i>Who wouldn't, if you could afford it?</i>

116
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,620
<i>But the attitude. The arrogance.</i>

117
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,846
<i>- Those holo-drops?
- This mockery of emperor palpatine?</i>

118
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,636
<i>You must have seen them. How
could you not? It's scandalous.</i>

119
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,226
- It's propaganda.
- Mother, you're being sold these ideas.

120
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,886
My poor boy.

121
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,556
<i>Your gullibility is breathtaking.</i>

122
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,556
All this anti-ghormanism,
it's not just talk anymore.

123
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,766
<i>We're getting new directives every
month and people are getting hurt.</i>

124
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,516
You're too close to know
what's really going on.

125
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,926
I'll tell you how close I am.

126
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,596
There are people in my office.
I'm looking at two of them right now.

127
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,636
They'll be choking down loyalty
oaths next week just to keep their jobs.

128
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,370
<i>I feel safer already.</i>

129
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,540
I'm here. I see what I see.

130
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,660
<i>This place is hardly
a threat to the empire.</i>

131
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,870
Don't become too much
of an individual, syril.

132
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,556
I have spiders to count.

133
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,700
<i>Same time next wee...</i>

134
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,700
This place is hardly
a threat to the empire.

135
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,790
Don't become too much
of an individual, syril.

136
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,950
- I have spiders to count.
- Same time next wee...

137
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,137
Hey.

138
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,226
- What?
- Let me see the bag.

139
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,790
- What for?
- Let me see the bag.

140
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,200
- Seriously?
- I don't like this place.

141
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,346
I thought you meant the other one.

142
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,226
I meant the good one.
This is the good one.

143
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,160
- We need to mix it up.
- We haven't been here for a month.

144
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,410
Look at us.

145
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
I can't sleep. You can't shop.

146
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,910
The mission is dinner.

147
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,386
I think we can handle it.

148
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,700
Okay. Come.

149
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,120
Hello there. What can I do for you two?

150
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,660
We got some lovely new fruits in.

151
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,976
- What about the melons?
- Excellent choice. They're in season.

152
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,910
Fresh from ukio. I'll find a good one.

153
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,750
I need three.

154
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,886
Ripe tonight or tomorrow?

155
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,160
Tonight.

156
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,016
I haven't seen you for a
while. Thought I'd lost you.

157
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,136
I've been around.

158
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,766
These are lovely. For a lovely lady.

159
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,450
- Anything else today?
- No. No, no. We're good.

160
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,886
Are those moski peppers?

161
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,266
Extra hot.

162
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,000
My husband wants a taste.

163
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,000
Is he strong enough?

164
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,870
He's tougher than he looks.

165
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,596
Okay.

166
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,176
One? Got two.

167
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,250
This is a lovely one.

168
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,766
- You, sir?
- Seriously?

169
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,426
Perhaps you've changed your mind.

170
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,886
- Really? Tonight's the night?
- Well, these are special.

171
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,346
I'm not a tourist. You know it.

172
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,636
- This one's different.
- I'm not buying another spider.

173
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,290
This one's free.

174
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,176
What do you want?

175
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,040
You're right. You're not a tourist.

176
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,250
Perhaps you wish to know
more about where you live.

177
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,580
There's a candy inside with
information on the wrapper.

178
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,750
- About what?
- There's a meeting.

179
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,450
You should come. You have the address.

180
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,580
We should've done this before.

181
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,476
There's already tarnish.

182
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,846
We were tired. We needed the rest.

183
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,596
Clean it with dirjo.

184
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,790
There's not much left.

185
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,080
Put it on the list.

186
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,290
Who else stays here?

187
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,556
You ever think about that?

188
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,476
No one's been here while we were gone.

189
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,410
You should see if we can leave stuff.

190
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,226
If we're gonna keep coming back.

191
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,580
I'll ask him.

192
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,000
What are you gonna tell him?

193
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,886
About what?

194
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,040
About what happened on
the mission. The soldier.

195
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,120
Luthen cares about results.

196
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,580
The deal went through. We won.

197
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,636
It had to be done.

198
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,160
There's nothing else to say.

199
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
What?

200
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,080
Hey, he was a threat.

201
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,476
He was a soldier.

202
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,290
Bix, you put on the uniform,
you take your chances.

203
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,580
I should stop thinking about him.

204
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,080
It's tough like this.

205
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,136
Boxed in.

206
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,870
It's like you said. It's when we relax.

207
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,620
I can't stop seeing his face.

208
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,620
It fades.

209
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,250
I wanna tell you it goes
away forever, but... I'd be lying.

210
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,120
Look at us.

211
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,450
Look at this place.

212
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,500
We're in a war.

213
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,726
Not everybody knows
it yet, but it's happening.

214
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,266
- People die.
- I wonder if he knew.

215
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,620
Well, he does now.

216
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,370
He was a soldier. He was a threat.

217
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,750
He was an imperial threat.

218
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,450
You and I are here
now because he's dead.

219
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,200
It had to be done.

220
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,290
It's good.

221
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,330
You sound surprised.

222
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,676
You're better than I am.

223
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,910
No, no. No, no, no. I'm
not gonna fall for that one.

224
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,750
Can we walk tomorrow?

225
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,040
That sounds nice.

226
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,700
The park. The big one.

227
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,596
I told you, they... They put cameras in.

228
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,910
We can cover up.

229
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,080
There's other places.

230
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,426
We're safe here.

231
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,370
I know it's not what we want, but...

232
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,580
The insanity of the city keeps us safe.

233
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,250
Then why are we being so paranoid?

234
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,700
- Just trying to protect us.
- You mean me.

235
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,750
- What's so wrong about that?
- It's warping things.

236
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,660
I don't wanna lose you again.

237
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,040
That's not up to us anymore.

238
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,250
You can't protect me.

239
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,846
Doing this... living like this...

240
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,910
Mission after mission.

241
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,726
If it's a war,

242
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,426
and you keep saying it is,
and I know that you're right,

243
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,476
but if it's a war, it's not
up to us what we save,

244
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,000
what we lose.

245
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,910
I love you.

246
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,056
And I regret every second
that we didn't spend together.

247
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,330
But I'm trying not to
count on anything anymore.

248
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,726
What am I messing up?

249
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,910
I can handle more than you think.

250
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,056
Which is why you are
awake every other night.

251
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,346
I'm not maarva. I'm not your sister.

252
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,636
- I can...
- seriously.

253
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,266
- I can handle it.
- What am I messing up?

254
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,096
You didn't kill that boy
because we're at war.

255
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,660
You killed him because he saw my face.

256
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,950
What's the difference?

257
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,040
I don't know.

258
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,910
But if I'm giving up everything.

259
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,000
I want to win. We have to.

260
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,016
I, left some files in the office.

261
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,476
Syril karn, division chief,
bureau of standards.

262
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,846
I know you.

263
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,120
It's gonna want after-hours clearance.

264
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,950
It'll take five minutes.

265
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,790
Sorry. We're not authorized.

266
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,926
I have a presentation with the
sector committee tomorrow morning.

267
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,080
I left my notes on my desk
like an idiot. I have to have them.

268
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,950
Take me five minutes.

269
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,790
Or I could tell you where they are.

270
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,226
- Where are you?
- The safe room.

271
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,926
- You were careful?
- Yes, of course, always.

272
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,226
- Look, I don't have much time.
- Sorry. Tell me.

273
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,790
They made contact.

274
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,766
<i>I've been invited to a meeting.</i>

275
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,516
- A meeting with who?
- I don't know. It's public.

276
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,226
It's a town hall. But this is them.

277
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,016
It's ghorman front. I know it.

278
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,226
<i>- How? How do you know?
- I told you I was being watched.</i>

279
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,346
They started breaking into the apartment.

280
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,386
I know they're tapping the office comms.

281
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,790
I assume I'm being followed all the time.

282
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,750
It has to be them. Who else could it be?

283
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,226
<i>- The meeting's tomorrow.
- Good.</i>

284
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,500
Very good.

285
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,160
Well, let's wait and see what happens.

286
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,370
<i>Well, I thought you'd
wanna brief partagaz.</i>

287
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,410
No.

288
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,540
<i>He'll want more than that.</i>

289
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,176
The 12 raids, conducted over all
three planets were highly successful.

290
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,386
Giving us a total of eight
seizures, yielding 200,000 credits,

291
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,926
75 restricted imperial
weapons and 34 arrests.

292
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,556
All of which leads us where?

293
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,056
We're ingesting the data.

294
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,346
- This was ten days ago?
- Yes, sir.

295
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,540
We? Who's the "we" at
this buffet of rebel plunder?

296
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,330
It's my sector, sir.

297
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,096
Supervisor heert.

298
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,846
- Yes, sir.
- The axis desk,

299
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,266
I notice you've taken
an interest in this seizure.

300
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,016
The weapons, sir. There are some pieces

301
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,846
that have come from
the axis supply chain.

302
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,136
Have we nothing more definitive?

303
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,096
- No, sir. Not yet.
- Not yet?

304
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,846
Ten days, two supervisors,
30 suspects in custody,

305
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,426
and we are still
ingesting and speculating.

306
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,806
Where's the intel?

307
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,596
So what do we squeeze
from these arrests that matter?

308
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,176
- No argument there, sir.
- Hardly the tempo required

309
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,766
for effective counterinsurgency.

310
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,676
It's disappointing on many levels.

311
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,596
I see a variety of causes.

312
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,830
Pick one!

313
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,370
We're arresting too many people.

314
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,540
We can't take it all in.

315
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,750
Go on.

316
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,040
Many of us...

317
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,910
Some of us...

318
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:50,120
Some of us have more people
in custody than we can process.

319
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:58,056
Supervisor jung raises a serious issue.

320
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,846
The problem is not unknown to me.

321
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,806
Colonel yularen and myself have a
meeting scheduled with the emperor

322
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,636
to discuss amplifying our intake process.

323
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,200
Well played, lonni.

324
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,410
Thank you for reminding us all
how this room is meant to function.

325
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,080
Let's get to work.

326
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,660
Thank you. I mean it.

327
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,200
- I'm having the same problems.
- I can't keep up.

328
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,700
We should talk it over. Not here, but.

329
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,290
I'm in all day.

330
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,370
You're onto something.

331
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,410
That's the job, isn't it?

332
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,500
Seventy-five restricted
imperial weapons?

333
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,620
You've had that ten days?

334
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,700
It's my desk now, dedra.

335
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,200
You don't call me in?

336
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,926
You don't think I could be helpful?

337
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,386
I won't hesitate if I need it.

338
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,160
Do you really think I care
about how it happens?

339
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,290
Andor must be found.

340
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,750
You can have all the glory.

341
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,226
Has it ever crossed your mind
that partagaz put me on axis

342
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,080
because I don't seek glory?

343
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,160
Well...

344
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,290
You've given me a lot to think about.

345
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,540
My door is open.

346
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,330
That doesn't look happy.

347
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,676
Yeah. She's been transferred.
Everything's pissing her off.

348
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,000
- I won't ask.
- But you, thank you.

349
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:52,016
He was gonna chew his way
through lagret and eat me for fun.

350
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,500
I don't know what I was thinking.

351
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,500
How do I repay you?

352
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,200
You can buy me lunch.

353
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,660
Done.

354
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,806
The p.O.R.D. Was presented as an
emergency measure, an overreaction.

355
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,830
<i>It was never meant to be permanent.</i>

356
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,976
The emperor might disagree.

357
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,136
Well, then, why ask for an extension?

358
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,290
Why?

359
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,660
Perhaps he just likes to see us dance.

360
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,450
Ghorman needs this
legislation more than anyone.

361
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,806
If I can't count on your
support, what's the point?

362
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,346
I need votes.

363
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,386
And you've been hiding from me. Why?

364
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,516
Sector boundaries, civil liberties,

365
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,846
personal freedom,
respect for local traditions.

366
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,266
You've been voting with
me on these issues for years.

367
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,040
This is security, mon.

368
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,580
You're confusing
criminality and politics here.

369
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,226
Really?

370
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,386
Are we finding criminals
or making them?

371
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,476
Why?

372
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,120
Why this? Why that?

373
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,926
I can't support the bill because
I can't risk chafing the emperor.

374
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,886
But why I'm in this position and
why it seems to be intensifying,

375
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,516
and why ghorman is
being persecuted so intently,

376
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,830
are questions no one
seems prepared to answer.

377
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,516
Go back two years.

378
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,636
Take the 75 planets with
the lowest crime rates.

379
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,766
Look at them now.

380
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,426
They're up 19%.

381
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,176
We can all game the numbers, mon.

382
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,120
And whose numbers are they?

383
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,266
I believe what I feel.

384
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:37,016
All doubts aside, there
is one glaring certainty.

385
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,830
If we do not stand
together, we will be crushed.

386
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,136
I know how hard
you're working this, mon.

387
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,950
I am close on the votes.

388
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,120
That's not what I hear.

389
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,136
Look at just the conviction
numbers we're allowed to see

390
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,596
in the places we know are peaceful.

391
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,976
An 18% rise in kaifo. Tepasi, 21.

392
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,200
A 38% increase in ghorman.

393
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,346
Ghorman, of all places.

394
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:11,306
I'm not sure linking anything to
ghorman right now is a good idea.

395
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,136
- The blockade.
- Who was there for you?

396
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,516
Who rallied the votes to lift the embargo?

397
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,080
I have never stopped thanking you.

398
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,120
Then help me kill the p.O.R.D.

399
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,176
Ghorman is a single-product economy.

400
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,516
We import almost
everything we need to survive.

401
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,976
The blockade didn't have to go very
long to remind us how vulnerable we are.

402
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,080
Dasi...

403
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,580
No.

404
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,176
I am constantly begging
my people to stay calm

405
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,250
and do nothing that
might make things worse.

406
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,290
Voting against the emperor right now
would be a total violation of that request.

407
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,410
Ghorman cannot take the risk.

408
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,620
I'm sorry, mon.

409
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,160
Hello, lonni.

410
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,620
- You've kept me waiting.
- I've been careful.

411
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,000
- Three months.
- I didn't have anything solid until today.

412
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,330
Well, let's have it.

413
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,096
You ask two questions.
One answers the other.

414
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,410
Spit it out!

415
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,500
Dedra meero is running ghorman.

416
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,250
She's been on it all year.
All this time. Hiding it.

417
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,766
I doubt there's three
people in the building

418
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,330
that know what I've just told you.

419
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,540
Why? Why ghorman?

420
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,700
I don't know. I can't believe
they've kept it so quiet.

421
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,596
Everybody thinks that she's
been put out to pasture since ferrix.

422
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,476
What's the obsession with
ghorman? What are they after?

423
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,266
I don't know. I'm trying to rethink
this all with her in the picture.

424
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,346
It doesn't make sense.

425
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,476
All the propaganda.

426
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,056
That can't be isb. It's too
slick. That's outside help.

427
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,636
And meero. Why? She's
a hunter, not a spin doctor.

428
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,596
- Maybe she's oversight.
- Of what?

429
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,386
A smear campaign is an
opening move, not an endgame.

430
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,080
I need the endgame!

431
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,700
I don't have it.

432
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,750
I'm trying.

433
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,290
Are you sure of this?

434
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,830
As of today.

435
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,806
And meero's off axis for good?

436
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,476
Not by choice, but yes.

437
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,386
I can't wait another three months,
lonni. There's too much going on.

438
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,200
You used to tell me to wait.

439
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,120
Those days are gone.

440
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,660
You're up-to-date on
the signal sequence?

441
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
Yes.

442
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,330
We'll be standing by.

443
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,750
{\an8}Le... lezine!

444
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,370
What do you think?

445
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,226
It's very passionate.

446
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,120
How much do you understand?

447
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,870
Not enough.

448
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,766
{\an8}She lost her family
in the tarkin massacre.

449
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,886
There was a promise that
the new imperial building

450
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,990
would never cast a
shadow across the memorial.

451
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,580
{\an8}Now they know the truth.

452
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,330
{\an8}Lezine!

453
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,926
{\an8}People think the new building
is meant to be a fortress.

454
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,370
He's telling them he doesn't know.

455
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,410
What do you think?

456
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,540
{\an8}Hello.

457
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,620
{\an8}- How are you?
- Her name is enza.

458
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,580
{\an8}Syril.

459
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,636
He's an imperial spy. Be careful.

460
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,910
It's not funny.

461
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,580
- It's not true, is it?
- No. I...

462
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,596
He invited me.

463
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,080
I'm at the bureau of standards.

464
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,790
Yeah. That's a relief.

465
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,790
- Hey.
- Hey.

466
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,870
I was thinking of
introducing you to my father.

467
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,040
Elector rylanz.

468
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,886
Syril karn.

469
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,846
I saw you from the stage.

470
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,266
I stand out that much?

471
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,870
No, that's what's interesting.

472
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,000
You're very brave to be here.

473
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,266
Am I in danger?

474
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,766
Certainly not from us.

475
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,370
This is ghorman.

476
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,136
I was wondering about your people.

477
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,790
There are no restrictions
on my movements in palmo.

478
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,750
And what will you take
away from this evening?

479
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
The strength of feeling.

480
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,120
Will you be writing a report?

481
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,410
No, I... to who?

482
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,266
I'm here as myself.

483
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,950
What a refreshing position.

484
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,016
It might be helpful to have your advice.

485
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,250
There must be some way to
make our appeals more effective.

486
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,516
I'm not sure that's allowed.

487
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,450
Is there a law against
seeking imperial counsel?

488
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,290
I suppose not.

489
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,056
We're drowning in rumors, syril.

490
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,386
Many people are starting to think this
new building is more than just an annex.

491
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:14,476
I'm not sure why the empire would
build an armory in the middle of palmo,

492
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,636
but I'm running out of answers.

493
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,806
Well, I have nothing
to do with the annex.

494
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,330
You must've seen the floor plans.

495
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,887
Those are classified.

496
00:38:21,911 --> 00:38:24,000
Certainly lends weight to the rumors.

497
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,950
I wouldn't know.

498
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:36,676
Sixteen years ago, grand moff tarkin

499
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:42,950
killed 500 peaceful, unarmed
ghormans in the middle of that Plaza.

500
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,726
You can imagine how
upset we would be to find out

501
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:56,790
there's an imperial military facility
rising over the monument to the fallen.

502
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,266
Yes.

503
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:03,160
Ghormans yearn for
peace and prosperity.

504
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,410
If you are writing a report...

505
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,040
Make that your headline.

506
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,870
Maybe we can do some good together.

507
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,790
Hey, you okay?

508
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah.

509
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,200
Couldn't sleep.

510
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,620
Dr. Gorst?

511
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,450
Not tonight.

512
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,950
Have a look.

513
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,160
It's flashing.

514
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,620
{\an8}We just got back.

515
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,910
Ever been to ghorman?

516
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,950
Where they make the fabric? No.

517
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,580
I want you to try something different.

518
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:39,120
This will be clean work. You
bring nothing but your wits.

519
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,700
I need an assessment.

520
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,136
Of what?

521
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,450
Of who. Carro rylanz.

522
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,766
Businessman, city official.

523
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:50,016
- He's running the ghorman front.
- You know him?

524
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,266
In my way.

525
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,556
We never met.

526
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,136
Kleya put a radio in,

527
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,200
there was a rebel pilot that went
down and we tried to help, but.

528
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,266
I can't go. He's too visible.

529
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,950
I'm not sure about the group.

530
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,870
It's a different kind of mission,
but it's not without danger.

531
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,596
And bix?

532
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,056
No, not this time.

533
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,250
No.

534
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,370
You have to go alone.

535
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,886
I have to think about that.

536
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,096
Think about this.

537
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,886
Think about the empire
choking ghorman so hard

538
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,976
that even carro rylanz
gets off his comfortable ass

539
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,870
to do something about it.

540
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,250
Ghorman would be a
remarkable place to turn our way.

541
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,450
I need to know more
before we get involved.

542
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,346
Bix will be fine.

543
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,790
You don't know that.

544
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,370
And I haven't said yes.

545
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,250
Reach out to kleya.

546
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,120
I want this done quickly.

547
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,830
Look at you.

548
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:50,080
Look at all your loveliness.

549
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,250
How I have dreamt of this.

550
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,290
Is she healthy?

551
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,136
Yes.

552
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,410
Everything's here?

553
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,200
All the tools? Full kit?

554
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,870
Eight variations. Six gauges.

555
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,176
Think of it, comrades. Fuel on demand.

556
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,950
All the rhydo that you can steal.

557
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,846
A galaxy of opportunities!

558
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:20,346
Work up a thirst. Find a vein.

559
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:23,846
Take what you want, when you want it.

560
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,556
Yes.

561
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,870
Has it been tested?

562
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,580
It works.

563
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,080
Who taught you this?

564
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,790
Why is that important?

565
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:40,080
Why?

566
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,700
What's more dangerous
than rhydonium?

567
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,120
Not many old pipe-poachers out there.
Not many who've lived to tell the tale.

568
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,080
Who taught you this?

569
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,040
I'm here to teach the variations.

570
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,200
More than that, I'm not allowed to say.

571
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,160
Look at this.

572
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,330
A brave one!

573
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,620
But how brave?

574
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,250
Have you ever seen a
man die from rhydonium?

575
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:16,540
Maybe you're like me,
maybe you, you love...

576
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,500
The smell of it.

577
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:24,500
And maybe you breathe
just a little too deeply.

578
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,500
Burned from the inside.

579
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,620
You watch your skin
blister as it melts away.

580
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:36,016
Or, you die loud.

581
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,120
Cut a line? Drop a wrench? Let it spill?

582
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:43,160
Don't even need a spark, do you, boy?

583
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,056
Do you?

584
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,410
Boom!

585
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,750
Burn from the outside.

586
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,580
What do they call you?

587
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,000
- Wilmon.
- Wil. Mon.

588
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,240
Wilmon the boy.

589
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,636
Have you ever done this for
real? Or just in a classroom?

590
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,870
I've done it.

591
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,846
Never alone, but I've done it.

592
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,950
- Twice.
- And you're still alive.

593
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:19,500
Pluti.

594
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:21,950
Pluti.

595
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,330
This is pluti.

596
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,806
He's smarter than he
looks. He'll be your student.

597
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,766
- Which variation?
- Pick one.

598
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:33,096
Start with your favorite.

599
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,676
Well, we should concentrate on
the station you're planning to hit.

600
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,790
You'll teach them all.

601
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,476
You'll know where we're
going when I tell you.

602
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,580
- But I need to leave tomorrow.
- Really?

603
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,620
- Is that what you need?
- It was an agreement.

604
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,290
This was negotiated.

605
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,726
I'll let our friend know that
you're being taken care of.

606
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,346
Find him a place to sleep.

607
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:56,700
You're here till I get what I need.
