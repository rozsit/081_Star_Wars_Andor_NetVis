1
00:00:00,916 --> 00:00:04,625
Wouldn't you rather give it all at once
to something real?

2
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:07,208
What would we be stealing?

3
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:10,916
The quarterly payroll
for an entire Imperial sector.

4
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:16,083
<i>If I was them,
this is how I'd do it.</i>

5
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:17,416
I'd spread it out.

6
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,916
Never climb the same fence twice.

7
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,583
Bix!

8
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,291
Who did this?

9
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,291
Timm!

10
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,166
<i>So you think it's hopeless, do you?</i>

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,375
Freedom? Independence?

12
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,208
We should just submit and be thankful?

13
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,500
Do I look thankful to you?

14
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,291
- Corporal.
- At your service.

15
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,708
Fall in.

16
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,791
Turn.

17
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,250
With me.

18
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,458
Tell me you'll be all right.

19
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,958
I'll be fine.

20
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,375
Go.

21
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,791
Let's go!

22
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,750
What is going on here?

23
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,791
I'm pinned down!

24
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,875
No!

25
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,125
Hang on!

26
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:16,875
<i>My assumption is,
you have no prospect for the future.</i>

27
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,375
I'm calling Uncle Harlo.

28
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,875
I'm calling in the family favor.

29
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,791
You wanna guess how much is in there?

30
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,458
Forty million a piece, give or take.

31
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,541
- So no rebellion for you?
- Oh, I'm a rebel. It's just, uh...

32
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,833
me against everybody else.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,541
He wanted to take the money
and leave you here.

34
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,958
- He wouldn't do that.
- I'm taking my cut.

35
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,083
I did my job.

36
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,208
I found someone I think can help me.

37
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,375
We're vulnerable enough.

38
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,166
We need funding, not more people.

39
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,541
Don't lecture me on vulnerability.

40
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,375
No one's more at risk than I am.

41
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:55,625
Syril?

42
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,083
Syril!

43
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,708
Is that what you're wearing?

44
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,875
It would seem so.

45
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,125
What makes you believe
the Bureau of Standards

46
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,166
is in the market for individuals?

47
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,041
It's a brown suit.

48
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:17,916
It's your interview.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,583
Perhaps, you would like to come along.

50
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,625
Uncle Harlo's influence
is not a thing to be trifled with.

51
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,083
How am I trifling?

52
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,375
He's done us a tremendous favor.

53
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,916
You need to remember you're not just
representing yourself today.

54
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,958
It's a brown suit.

55
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,041
The collar.

56
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,041
- What about it?
- It's high.

57
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,250
You've had it raised.

58
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,625
I had it tailored.

59
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,500
Everything says something, Syril.

60
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,375
I've tried to make you understand that,
you've resisted.

61
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,114
What is it
that you hear my collar saying?

62
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,666
"Look at me.

63
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,416
"I don't believe in myself.

64
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,750
"I am desperate for approval."

65
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,101
<i>We have
distressing reports are reaching us</i>

66
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,791
<i>that a terror attack and robbery</i>

67
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,041
<i>have taken place
at the Imperial Armory on Aldhani,</i>

68
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,500
<i>with multiple fatalities reported.</i>

69
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,666
What happened?

70
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,726
- Rabble.
<i>- ...a Blockade Order was issued...</i>

71
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,934
They attacked a garrison.

72
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,333
They'll regret it.

73
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,958
<i>...officials on the scene
are still assessing the loss</i>

74
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,833
<i>and searching for the conspirators.</i>

75
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:23,166
<i>The criminals responsible
for last night's atrocity on Aldhani</i>

76
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,791
<i>think they've taken
the Empire by surprise.</i>

77
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,458
<i>We know better.</i>

78
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,833
We know the real shock will be

79
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:34,875
when they discover how ready
and eager we are to respond,

80
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,916
<i>to be prepared, to be here this morning</i>

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,375
<i>and know that the only question</i>

82
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:44,208
<i>we need to answer
is how tight to close our fist.</i>

83
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,791
<i>This is why we plan.</i>

84
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:50,708
<i>This is why we work so hard
when we're at peace.</i>

85
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:56,541
<i>This is why we recruit so carefully
and demand so much.</i>

86
00:04:56,625 --> 00:05:01,625
The following measures
will be adopted Empire-wide as of today.

87
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:07,333
A tribute tax equal to five times
the amount stolen from Aldhani

88
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:11,125
will be levied on any sector
harboring partisan activity.

89
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:16,250
We will make it clear
that no one steals from the Empire.

90
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:23,250
The use of any local custom, festival,
or tradition as cover for rebel activity

91
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:29,166
will trigger permanent revocation
of Imperial tolerance.

92
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,541
I spoke with Emperor Palpatine last night,

93
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:41,541
and he's assured me that the ISB
will be taking the lead going forward.

94
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,166
No one in this room

95
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,083
should have trouble accessing
Army or Naval resources in future.

96
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,458
The Emperor will be convening
an emergency session of the Senate

97
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,916
to propose a legislation package
of bills and amendments

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,750
that will free our hands in all matters
of surveillance, search, and seizure.

99
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:07,583
We will be invoking the Public Order
Resentencing Directive later today.

100
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,416
P-O-R-D.

101
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,000
Any criminal act,
with even indirect effect on the Empire,

102
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,791
will henceforth be branded
a Class One Offense.

103
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,625
All prison sentences
are immediately re-evaluated.

104
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:28,583
All outstanding fines and levies
are to be paid in full.

105
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,125
- I have assured the Emperor...
<i>- You're not pleased.</i>

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,041
<i>We're playing
straight into their hands.</i>

107
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,833
- Whose hands?
- The rebels.

108
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,333
This is exactly what they want.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,625
We're treating what happened
at Aldhani like a robbery.

110
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,208
What would you call it?

111
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:46,958
An announcement.

112
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,750
<i>Preliminary investigation puts the loss</i>

113
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,250
<i>at over eighty million credits.</i>

114
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,291
<i>All military personnel
at the garrison have been replaced</i>

115
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,666
<i>and are being interrogated by ISB.</i>

116
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,666
<i>ISB confirms the tracking devices</i>

117
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,250
<i>in the escape craft were disabled
prior to it reaching hyperspace.</i>

118
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:06,041
<i>134 Aldhani residents
have been taken into custody</i>

119
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,291
<i>under suspicion
of abetting the terrorists.</i>

120
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,666
Mon Mothma.

121
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,416
Without warning?

122
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,000
Wipe the smile off your face.

123
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,500
I should've called.

124
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,958
We're on our way to the Senate,
I realized we'd be passing by.

125
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,521
- I'll be right back.
- Ma'am.

126
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,208
Perrin likes it,
I'm just not sure he loves it.

127
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,875
- Ah.
- I think I might want the other one.

128
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,166
Was this you?

129
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,583
What do you mean?

130
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,333
The garrison. Aldhani.

131
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,458
Ah! Is it true?

132
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,333
Kleya was just...

133
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,291
I've been worried
you might do something like this.

134
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,583
How I wish I had.

135
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,500
Let's have a look.

136
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,500
I don't believe you.

137
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,267
- Well, you'll have to try harder.
- Don't you dare talk to me like that.

138
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,208
Revolutions are expensive.

139
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,041
I told you, I'm doing everything I can.

140
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,875
Your "everything"
seemed to be all about

141
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,625
bringing in a savior
to access your family funds.

142
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,166
It was you, wasn't it?

143
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:39,333
I explained to you the risk of new faces,
but you seemed to know better.

144
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,666
You realize what you've done?

145
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,416
I thought you were here
to tell me about the meeting.

146
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,541
It's tonight.

147
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,416
They may reschedule.

148
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,125
I warned you when we started.

149
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,375
- You told me we were building a network.
- What were my words?

150
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,083
This is something else entirely.

151
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,333
"Turning back will be impossible."

152
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,250
You knew where this was going.

153
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,416
You've always known.

154
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,041
Has anyone ever made a weapon
that wasn't used?

155
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,250
The network's been built. It's up.

156
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,750
It grows or it dies.

157
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,541
<i>We've waited long enough.</i>

158
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,041
<i>You realize what you've set in motion?</i>

159
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,601
<i>It was time for that as well.</i>

160
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,708
<i>- Palpatine won't hesitate now.</i>
- Exactly!

161
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,708
We need it.

162
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,833
We need the fear.

163
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,583
- We need them to overreact.
- You can't be serious.

164
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,458
The Empire has been choking us
so slowly, we're starting not to notice.

165
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,333
The time has come to force their hand.

166
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,833
People will suffer.

167
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,041
That's the plan.

168
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,166
You're not angry at me.

169
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,416
I'm just saying out loud
what you already know.

170
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,333
There will be no rules going forward.

171
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,250
If you're not willing
to risk your conscience,

172
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,208
then surrender and be done with it.

173
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,458
We need every credit
we can get our hands on.

174
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,375
Let me know how the meeting goes.

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm afraid I won't be taking
either of these pieces this morning.

176
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:27,666
I'll have some new things
coming in very, very soon.

177
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,208
I'll be sure to come by.

178
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,916
Always at your service, Senator.

179
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,083
Always at your service.

180
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,291
I hope she's worth it.

181
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,625
<i>Well, we'll see, won't we?</i>

182
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,083
We can't hide forever.

183
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:11,041
People all think we're kidding
when we say it, but it's true.

184
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,500
There are no small jobs
at the Bureau Of Standards.

185
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,166
I spoke with your uncle.

186
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,125
Some sectors might naturally appear
more exciting from the outside.

187
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,958
Weights and Gauges
may seem a more vibrant arena

188
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:31,458
than Redundancy or Verification,
but walk the floor,

189
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:35,958
talk to any lifetime employee,
you'll be surprised.

190
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:37,958
I'm sure.

191
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,791
Morlana One.

192
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,666
Yes, uh...

193
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,416
There's a rebel murderer running free

194
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,041
because of corruption and laxity
in the corporate authority.

195
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,625
I was punished
for trying to uphold the law.

196
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,875
Do my job. Maintain public safety.

197
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,125
Two men dead.

198
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,041
Co-workers.

199
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,083
I believe that we have laws for a reason.

200
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:08,083
I fully intend to clear my name
and have my record expunged.

201
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,708
Why don't we start that process now?

202
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:17,416
Probably best for everyone to just edit
this a bit before signing you in.

203
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,380
I'm sure your uncle would approve.

204
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,625
Fresh start, eh?

205
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,125
New beginnings.

206
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,666
We just happen to have
an immediate opening in Fuel Purity.

207
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,458
I'd hate to see you miss your chance.

208
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,500
<i>Exit right for the Senate level.</i>

209
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,541
<i>Exit left for the downtown, midtown level.</i>

210
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,541
<i>Four-nine vector six.</i>

211
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,166
<i>L-U-H-three-four-one.</i>

212
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,333
<i>Security clearance code...</i>

213
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,583
- The food is superb.
- It's quite exquisite...

214
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,750
- At ease, Attendant.
- Yes, sir.

215
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,666
Ma'am. Sir.

216
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,166
Your tunic.

217
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,625
Sorry, sir. Ma'am.

218
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,416
Sorry.

219
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,666
What is your name?

220
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,666
Felzonis.

221
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,166
Attendant Felzonis.

222
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:04,708
Hmm. I need a Multi-Sector Data Blend
going back two years.

223
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,791
The survey pool is Imperial Naval bases
and repair facilities.

224
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:12,708
I want a record of all missing avionics,
comm, navigation, and targeting equipment.

225
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,666
For which star system?

226
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,000
All star systems.

227
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,125
Is that a problem?

228
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:25,083
I'll need this report kept confidential
and a copy sent exclusively to my office.

229
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,916
Can I rely on you
for that level of discretion?

230
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,500
Absolutely.

231
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,416
Yes. Can do.

232
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,583
Will do.

233
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,416
Will do.

234
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,500
Right. Get on with it.

235
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,750
Where is he?

236
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,583
I shouldn't even be here.

237
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,000
Neither of us should.

238
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,125
The money's safe.

239
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,958
We know.

240
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,875
It's been moved already.
You've done exceptional work.

241
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,083
It's the trawler
that we're more worried about.

242
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,083
It's buried. Gone for good.

243
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,250
- You're sure?
- Yes.

244
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,416
He read your message.

245
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,666
I really thought he'd be here.

246
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,625
Every loss is different.

247
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:01,833
Every one's the same.

248
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,666
I recruited Taramyn myself.

249
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,291
Nemik, Gorn, they'll all be remembered.

250
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,833
That's it?

251
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,583
He had doubts about Skeen.

252
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,458
It's one less thing to worry about.

253
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,625
Have you heard from Cinta?

254
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,916
She's doing what she was told.

255
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,833
Receiving messages
is just as dangerous as sending them.

256
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,375
You should keep that in mind.

257
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,166
We have a loose end.

258
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,833
Cassian Andor, who you know as Clem.

259
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,083
You need to find him.

260
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,791
Find him?

261
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,333
We can't have him walking around
with Luthen in his head.

262
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,666
You mean kill him.

263
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,166
This is what revolution looks like, Vel.

264
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,458
We'll send you what we have on him.

265
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,458
Who's there?

266
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,125
I hear you!

267
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,041
Just, just hold on!

268
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,726
- Cassian.
- Oh! Get in here.

269
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,750
- Since when do we lock the door?
- Oh!

270
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,125
Where have you been?

271
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:45,083
Look at you.

272
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,375
You can't stay here, Cass. It's not safe.

273
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,208
There is t-t-troopers now.

274
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,041
- That was fast.
- Yeah, they came the next day.

275
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,583
Kicked out Pre-Mor, took over the hotel.

276
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,875
Ferrix is under Imperial authority.

277
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,458
You shouldn't be here.

278
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,750
Someone turned me in.

279
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:15,791
You don't know?

280
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,416
Know what?

281
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,416
- T-T-Timm.
- What?

282
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,166
Timm Karlo turned you in.

283
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,958
No point in stewing over it,
he's dead now.

284
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,375
The Corpos killed him
when they were coming after you.

285
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,750
How do you know all this?

286
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,083
Everyone knows it.

287
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,625
- Bix knew about it?
- No.

288
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,416
She was coming to warn you,
and Timm was trying to stop her,

289
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,875
or to catch her, I don't know.
I've... I've heard both.

290
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,166
But you can't be here, Cass.

291
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,791
The Imperials are here to stay.

292
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,791
They're not going away this time.

293
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,125
It's all come undone.

294
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,208
We won't have to worry about that.

295
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,125
What are you talking about?

296
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,083
We're getting out of here.

297
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:55,916
We're leaving.

298
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:57,916
To go where?

299
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,416
Anywhere we want.

300
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,458
I got lucky.

301
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,708
I scored.

302
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,583
I've got enough credits
to get us anywhere.

303
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,958
We're gonna clear out.

304
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,958
Leave this mess behind.

305
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,791
When d-d-do we go?

306
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,583
- We go tonight.
- Tonight?

307
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,791
Yeah, why not?

308
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,875
What do we need to take
but the three of us?

309
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,458
Huh? Get out of the cold and damp.

310
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,208
Find somewhere warm and easy.

311
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,500
I can make it happen.

312
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,083
It's all gonna be different now, Ma.

313
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
What's wrong?

314
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,858
Just such a lot to take in.

315
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,625
No one knows I'm here.

316
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,583
We take what we can carry,
and we disappear.

317
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:53,000
It's just such a big idea,
you know, I... I get so tired.

318
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,625
You surprised me.

319
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,791
What am I thinking?
It's... It's late.

320
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,291
Yeah, yeah. You... You gotta rest.

321
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:06,041
I'll check up on Bix, and we'll pull out
first thing in the morning.

322
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,375
- All right?
- F-F-First thing.

323
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,083
- Let's do that.
- Ah.

324
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,125
Thank you.

325
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,333
Sorry we're not having dinner.

326
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,875
How long are you staying?

327
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,833
I'm back to Chandrila tomorrow.

328
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,625
I haven't been home all year.

329
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,166
You haven't missed much.

330
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,291
I've missed you.

331
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,375
You always seem to be away when I'm there.

332
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,958
I'm not that hard to find, Mon.

333
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,041
Not for a Senator.

334
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:45,833
You're right.

335
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,156
- I've been a poor friend.
- No, that's not what I meant.

336
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,958
Life takes us where it will.

337
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,083
You've become all this. All these years.

338
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,375
We're both a long way
from where we started.

339
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,583
Have I changed so much?

340
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,041
- We've all had to adapt.
- Is it that bad?

341
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,166
I just can't imagine living here, Mon.

342
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,250
Like this.

343
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,083
Coruscant.

344
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,625
No escape.

345
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,916
Just this glimpse of what it's like here,
what you have to do.

346
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,875
It can be challenging.

347
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,500
You carry it gracefully.

348
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,833
Can I trust you, Tay?

349
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:26,666
Can I call back our old kinship
and share some truth with you?

350
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,750
Mother.

351
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,000
Leida.

352
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,250
- Do you remember my daughter?
- Of course.

353
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,375
This is Tay Kolma,
one of my oldest friends.

354
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,625
How do you do?

355
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:39,875
You've met before.

356
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,625
Bank Of Kolma?
You know Adrine and Marsa from back home.

357
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,000
- My sisters.
- Um, I'm not sure.

358
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,059
It's been a long time,
and you've certainly grown up.

359
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,708
So everyone says.

360
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,041
Typical banker.
No one pays me to be original.

361
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,791
Oh. Father said I needed to ask you
if I may be excused.

362
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:56,916
Yes.

363
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:58,916
You're excused.

364
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,333
- Lovely seeing you again.
- Uh, yes. Have fun, Mother.

365
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,291
Another part of the challenge.

366
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,375
It's a difficult age.

367
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:17,166
I've spent a great deal of time
thinking about this conversation, Tay.

368
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,291
I want to tell you something

369
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:25,708
that only three people
in the galaxy know about.

370
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,750
Why would you want to do that?

371
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:31,958
Because I need your help.

372
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,708
And I'm hoping I can trust you.

373
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,250
Is this personal or political?

374
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,041
Political.

375
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,250
- Then I'd suggest you hesitate.
- Why?

376
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,666
Like I said, we've both changed.

377
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,791
I've done more
than grow weary of the Empire.

378
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:54,791
I'm afraid you'd find my politics
a bit strong for your taste.

379
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,625
Your world is inescapably
linked to the Empire.

380
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,625
You're with these people all the time.

381
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,125
I'm not sure
you're aware how far afield

382
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:07,208
some of us have taken
our political allegiances these days.

383
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:12,541
Sorry, I think I've had too much
of Perrin's Embassy punch.

384
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,166
Drink up.

385
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:19,166
Drink up, Tay, and keep smiling

386
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:24,333
as if we're having
a happy chat about childhood days.

387
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,041
I'm not sure I understand.

388
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,166
No, you don't.

389
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:37,250
What you see, what people say about me,
it's a clear picture, isn't it?

390
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,375
I'm a polite, sometimes-indecisive Senator

391
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:43,875
who spends her days fighting and failing
to protect Separatist do-gooders

392
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,500
and battle Empire overreach.

393
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:51,041
An irritation, as you so harshly put it.

394
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,791
- I've made you angry, I...
- No, no. You've set me free.

395
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:58,625
I've been wondering all day
how I could be sure of confiding in you.

396
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,750
I don't know what we're talking about.

397
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,250
It's a lie.

398
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:09,125
The Mon Mothma
people think they know, it's a lie.

399
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,291
It's a projection.

400
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,416
It's a front.

401
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,625
Smile.

402
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,875
I've learned from Palpatine.

403
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,500
I show you the stone in my hand,
you miss the knife at your throat.

404
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,625
Where is this going, Mon?

405
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,833
The Grand Vizier has infiltrated
my Separatist Coalition meetings.

406
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:41,416
My driver is an ISB plant and reports
on my secret humanitarian programs.

407
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:45,500
They know they watch me, and I want that,

408
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,291
because as long as everyone
thinks I'm an irritation,

409
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:52,000
there's a good chance
they'll miss what I'm really doing.

410
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,875
What are you really doing?

411
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,291
Raising money.

412
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:59,416
I need to access my family accounts.
Until recently,

413
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,666
I was able to dip in and out of
my family fortune without concern.

414
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,458
That's changed.

415
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:08,291
I need help.

416
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,708
Raising money for what?

417
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,416
I'm forming a Chandrilan
charitable outreach program.

418
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:16,583
I'll ask you to be chairman.

419
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,916
It will involve visits here to Coruscant.

420
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:24,750
It will appear to be another
of my benevolent and useless irritations.

421
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,416
I've explored the alternatives.

422
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
You're my best shot.

423
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,041
You haven't answered my question.

424
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:34,125
And I won't.

425
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,291
You're better off not knowing.

426
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:40,541
Or perhaps, you'd find my politics
a bit strong for your taste.

427
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,583
Perrin's on his way over.

428
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:48,083
He knows none of this.
He's not to be trusted.

429
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:51,083
Smile.

430
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,750
There you are.

431
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,791
Reminiscing, are we? School days?

432
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:56,395
Are we that predictable?

433
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:59,125
- There's a reunion coming up.
- Oh, don't remind me.

434
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:02,458
She pretends not to care,
but we both know better, don't we?

435
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:03,750
It was ever thus.

436
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:07,125
May I steal her back? There's a few guests
that require special handling.

437
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,333
Of course.

438
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:09,833
To be continued.

439
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:02,666
Hey.

440
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,083
<i>Cass?</i>

441
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,750
Hey.

442
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,375
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

443
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,166
Remember when your father caught me
climbing over that wall?

444
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,916
<i>This is the last place you should be.</i>

445
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:27,625
I think those
were his exact words.

446
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:29,250
<i>It's not safe here.</i>

447
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:34,916
Timm?

448
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,625
<i>I guess he thought
you and I were back together.</i>

449
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,416
Why would he think that?

450
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,375
<i>You can't be as surprised as I was.</i>

451
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:49,958
What happened to you?

452
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,625
I ran into a wall, like I do.

453
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,125
You can't be here, Cass.

454
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,583
Troopers won't catch me.

455
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,458
Not here.

456
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:06,625
They won't have to.

457
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,041
You'll be turned in.

458
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,083
- By who?
- By who?

459
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,625
By anyone.

460
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,583
People blame you for what happened.

461
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:18,625
Blame me?

462
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:23,958
You killed two Corpos
and came home to hide.

463
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:26,291
Put the entire town at risk.

464
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:29,625
- Now there's Imperials on the street.
- If Timm had kept his mouth shut.

465
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,791
If this, if that. If you, if me, if Timm.

466
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,166
We were doing a deal you...

467
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,083
You scam, you borrow,
you lie, you disappear.

468
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:41,500
Your crazy boyfriend tries
to get me killed, and I'm the villain?

469
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,833
You need to get as far away
from here as you can.

470
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:48,333
Wow.

471
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:51,916
I will.

472
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:54,625
I am.

473
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:58,416
You won't have to worry about me anymore.

474
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:06,958
I need to know about the other guy.

475
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:09,458
The buyer, who is he?

476
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,541
- I don't know.
- You're lying.

477
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,375
I'm not.

478
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,875
Paak introduced us,
but swears he doesn't know either.

479
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:17,625
I have a comm. I call. I wait.

480
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:19,166
Sometimes they respond.

481
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,125
He knew all about me. How?

482
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:22,416
I... I don't know.

483
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,791
And you're right, he did know.

484
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,291
He knew that the Corpos were on you.
But not from me.

485
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:35,666
You ever talk to him again,
tell him I held up my end of the deal,

486
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:38,500
and he needs to forget about me.

487
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:41,750
And that goes for everybody.

488
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:48,291
I've done it before.

489
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,250
12,000 credits.

490
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:56,625
That's everything I owe.

491
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:01,125
Xan, Nurchi, Brasso, Deema.

492
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:02,625
Twelve should cover it.

493
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,166
Be careful, Cass.

494
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,291
You too.

495
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:48,833
This is not our fight, Cass.

496
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,958
Don't worry.
They won't be here long.

497
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:53,875
They're just gonna raise
their silly flag and fly away.

498
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,500
Long live the Republic!

499
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,708
Free Ferrix!

500
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:59,541
Don't move. Stay here.

501
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:02,333
Hey, guys! Calm down!

502
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:05,166
- You're only making things worse!
- Halt!

503
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:08,916
Turn!

504
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,916
Ready arms!

505
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,166
M-M-Maarva.

506
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,083
He's b-b-back.

507
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,458
I was coming to find you.

508
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:48,541
Here I am.

509
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,875
You haven't done much packing.

510
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:53,500
She says we can't go.

511
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,333
Bee. Quiet.

512
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,458
What is this?

513
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:01,666
I'm not going.

514
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,958
What are you talking about?

515
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,208
I'm staying.

516
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,125
But it's... it's not safe.

517
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:09,083
I know all that.

518
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,750
I can't be here.

519
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:15,375
You said it yourself,
"It's all come undone."

520
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,458
There's an Imperial barracks on Rix Road.

521
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:19,916
Good luck to them.

522
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:23,291
- You wanna live under that?
- It's happening everywhere.

523
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:26,000
Well, we'll find a place
they haven't ruined yet.

524
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,333
I'm already there.

525
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,541
That place is in my head.

526
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:32,750
They can build as many barracks
as they like, they'll never find me.

527
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:34,313
What's left to keep you here?

528
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,833
The Rebellion.

529
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:39,833
What?

530
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:44,125
Ferrix has been hiding long enough.

531
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,375
So now you're taking on the Empire?

532
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,166
Laugh if you want to.

533
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,250
Who's laughing? This is madness.

534
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:52,333
No, it's not.

535
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:57,250
It's overdue, and probably doomed,
and I'm too old, and I don't care anymore.

536
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:01,166
For 13 years,
every time I walk down Rix Road,

537
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,875
I turn off before I get to the square.

538
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,041
I take the long way around

539
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:06,250
so I don't have to think
about Clem hanging there.

540
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,458
Then yesterday,
I heard about this attack at Aldhani.

541
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:18,041
Have you heard about this?

542
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:19,166
What about it?

543
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,666
Well, Bee played me the news.

544
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,791
Do you know what I'm talking about?

545
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:26,000
<i>Yeah, yeah,
the garrison at Aldhani.</i>

546
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,833
I heard that, I put on my best coat,

547
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:30,375
and I walked across the square

548
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:31,875
with a smile on my face.

549
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:39,083
If there are heroes brave enough
to take on a whole Imperial garrison,

550
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:41,125
I'm brave enough to stick it out here.

551
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,916
I... I don't expect you to understand.

552
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:53,666
Aldhani was just a robbery.

553
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,125
People are standing up.

554
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,083
Yeah, and getting killed for it.

555
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But there's work that will need doing.

556
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,083
Yeah? What is that?

557
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,708
Whatever it takes.

558
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,958
I've been lying around
waiting to die long enough.

559
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:09,958
You can't beat them, Maarva.

560
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:12,708
Not if I run away.

561
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:18,250
You have a different path, Cass,
and I am not judging you.

562
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,125
Everything you've been through,

563
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:24,291
everything that was taken away from you
before you even started?

564
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:28,583
Take all the money you've found
and go and find some peace.

565
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,250
I won't have peace.

566
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,916
I'll be worried about you all the time.

567
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,791
That's just love.

568
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,875
Nothing you can do about that.

569
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,250
I've never loved anything
the way I love you,

570
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,166
and I've never fretted on anything more,
but this time...

571
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:56,916
you can't stay, and I can't go.

572
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,125
- C-C-Can I speak now?
- No!

573
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:09,708
Tell me you understand.

574
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:11,791
I don't.

575
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:16,083
You will. You'll see.

576
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:32,250
And just one more thing... Just...

577
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,916
Stop searching for your sister.

578
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,666
It's a fantasy.

579
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:41,375
There were no survivors on Kenari.

580
00:35:46,541 --> 00:35:48,666
What happened there
was not your responsibility.

581
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,000
You were a child.

582
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,041
Let it go.

583
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:03,041
I'm coming back.

584
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,458
Of course you are.

585
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,625
The alternative analysis is that
by comparing the detention numbers

586
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:22,625
to the frequency of surprise inspections

587
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,708
we're under-allocating
our harbor patrol units.

588
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:28,166
So, three theories, Mr. Jung?

589
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,250
Yes, sir.

590
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,625
Three possible explanations

591
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:35,458
for why you have failed to keep pace
with your neighboring sectors.

592
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:38,083
- That's correct.
- I'm correct?

593
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:40,083
Your approval is heartening.

594
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,208
Your guidance would be welcome, sir.

595
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:45,500
Very well, let's have a full audit
of all hyperspace lanes

596
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:49,833
leading to Ord Mantell
on my desk by this time tomorrow.

597
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,000
As you wish.

598
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:54,333
- Mr. Blevin.
- Sir.

599
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,500
I sense something eager
in you this morning.

600
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,416
Am I mistaken?

601
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,791
No, sir. And at risk
of repetition, you are correct.

602
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:04,708
Good news, is it?

603
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:05,791
I'm afraid not.

604
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:09,083
I wish to lodge a charge
against a fellow supervisor.

605
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:11,166
Proceed.

606
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,208
I believe our Sector Protocols,

607
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:15,333
as described in the ISB Code Of Conduct,

608
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:18,958
are being violated by Supervisor Meero,
and that this overreach,

609
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:23,291
for which she was previously reprimanded,
risks compromising Imperial safety

610
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,916
to a degree that silence
is no longer possible.

611
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,958
You think this forum appropriate?

612
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:29,041
I do.

613
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,625
It's a serious charge.

614
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:33,291
I believe
you'll share my sense of urgency.

615
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,416
Supervisor Meero,

616
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,375
do you mind having your integrity
ventilated in public?

617
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,750
No, sir.

618
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:43,208
Supervisor Blevin obviously finds
my conduct a more interesting subject

619
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,875
than the advancement
of Integrated Imperial Security.

620
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:49,375
He's put a lot into it,
I'm curious to hear his insights.

621
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:51,708
This is Ferrix, is it not?

622
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,125
Yes, sir.

623
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:54,208
Your sector.

624
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:57,083
There was an unusual piece
of Naval equipment recovered.

625
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,875
Meero wanted your crime reports.

626
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:01,083
You determined her request
was out of order

627
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:04,250
- and in violation of the chain of command.
- That's not accurate.

628
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:07,125
You advised me
to reinforce my suspicions with data

629
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,041
and to be careful
in my work going forward.

630
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,125
Careful?

631
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,125
Is that your defense?
You've been "careful"?

632
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,416
I'd be curious
how many people at this table

633
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,875
will think it "careful" that you've found
a way to access our sector data

634
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:21,208
without ever filing a request.

635
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:22,750
Is that true, Dedra?

636
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:27,125
Yes.

637
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:29,833
I used the Imperial Emergency Act
in the wake of Aldhani

638
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:32,666
to gather data across multiple sectors
without official sanction.

639
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,458
But that is the wrong question.

640
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:37,958
I'd like to know if anyone here believes
the Rebellion plans its actions

641
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:40,708
around the artificially constructed
boundaries of our sectors.

642
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:43,125
Major Partagaz created those sectors.

643
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:45,708
As organizing principles,
not personal playthings.

644
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,583
Do you think the rebels care
about the lines we draw on maps?

645
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:51,375
You think the relevance of my work
has been supplanted?

646
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,375
Systems either change or die.

647
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,208
Sir.

648
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:03,958
Thesis, please.

649
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,333
There is a focused,
organized rebel effort

650
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:09,375
to acquire highly-restricted
Imperial military components.

651
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:10,458
Your evidence?

652
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:12,791
By accessing unfiltered
Sector Crime Reports

653
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:15,750
I can now prove a link between the theft
of our most secret equipment

654
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:18,750
and its distribution
to rebel groups across the galaxy.

655
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:22,000
This is hard, verifiable data
you are prepared to present?

656
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:23,583
Yes, sir.

657
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,125
I believe Supervisor Blevin is aware
I have a documented file ready to go.

658
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:30,041
I believe his accusations
here this morning

659
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:33,083
have more to do with self-preservation
than any sense of urgency.

660
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:36,708
What's more urgent
than a renegade intelligence officer?

661
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:42,625
Imagine if everyone in this room played
as loose with the rules as you.

662
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:44,750
Excellent suggestion, Blevin.

663
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:48,583
I'm wondering where we'd be right now
if everyone here

664
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:51,166
showed the same endeavor
as Supervisor Meero.

665
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:54,250
I'll have to think about that.

666
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:59,291
For the moment, I'm reassigning
the Morlana sector to Supervisor Meero.

667
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:01,500
Ferrix is of great interest to her

668
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:04,041
and has clearly
become a distraction for you.

669
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:07,208
I see no urgent problem,
but, as always,

670
00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:10,375
I salute the provocative
exchange of ideas.

671
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:12,875
Supervisor Grandi,
you will accelerate your schedule.

672
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:16,791
Jung, I will expect your report
on Ord Mantell tomorrow.

673
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,083
Thank you all for the lively session.

674
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:22,916
Dedra, if you'd walk with me a moment.

675
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,166
Well-played.

676
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:37,833
Thank you, sir.

677
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:39,708
Watch your back.

678
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,041
Keef.

679
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,750
Keef?

680
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,250
I'll be out in a minute.

681
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:27,541
What're you doing?

682
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,375
Washing up.

683
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:35,125
I'm gonna take a walk.

684
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,458
Well, we need stuff.

685
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,750
Arkie's up the beach.

686
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:40,833
He'll be open.

687
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,750
I was planning to go the other way.

688
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:45,750
Mmm, Arkie has the new flavors.

689
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:49,000
And we need Peezos.

690
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,333
Don't forget the Peezos.

691
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,125
We ran out of Peezos?

692
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:54,833
Peezos and Revnog.

693
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:58,333
The greenie green ones.

694
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,000
The greenie Revnog.

695
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,500
You liked it, too.

696
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:04,916
Keef? Are you listening?

697
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,291
Ah.

698
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:13,416
Go! Go! Run!

699
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:15,375
Go, go, go, go!

700
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:19,958
Hey, you! Stop!

701
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:21,375
Hold it!

702
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:28,083
Freeze!

703
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:02,875
What are you doing?

704
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:05,750
- Excuse me?
- You keep looking around.

705
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,916
Just trying to figure out what's going on.

706
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,226
You a part of it?

707
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,500
Part of what?

708
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:12,083
Don't play dumb.

709
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:13,500
No, I'm on my way to the store.

710
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:14,666
Back up.

711
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,666
Stand right there.

712
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:19,000
You look like you're sweating.

713
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,500
- Well, it's hot.
- Or you've been running.

714
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:22,958
Why would I be running?

715
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:25,000
Because you're a part of it.

716
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:26,083
Part of what?

717
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:29,125
- I'll ask the questions.
- Go! Run!

718
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,666
Pier Nine, Pier Nine,
runners heading south!

719
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,541
Move it! Go!

720
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:36,583
I can wait for you here, if you want.

721
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:37,892
Friends of yours?

722
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:40,291
- What?
- You heard me.

723
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:41,708
Wait, no... Uh...

724
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:44,416
I don't know anybody here.
I'm a tourist.

725
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,416
Tourists don't run.

726
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,041
But I'm not running.

727
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,000
You got that right.
That window is shut.

728
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:56,375
I'm just going to the store.

729
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:57,583
It's right there.

730
00:43:57,666 --> 00:43:59,583
You need to calm down, sir.

731
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:01,166
Droid assistance, please.

732
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:09,750
Uh... What? Wait. What is he...
No, this is crazy.

733
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:12,500
Hang onto this one for me.
I wanna check the shelter.

734
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:15,375
He said hang?

735
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:17,166
No, no, no. No.

736
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:19,750
No, you misunderstand.

737
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:22,458
No, he... he meant watch.

738
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:25,458
- Hang?
- No, no, he means watch.

739
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:34,375
Hang.

740
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:38,458
Tell him!

741
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:40,125
Tell him you mean watch!

742
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,708
Charges?

743
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:48,375
Loitering at a crime scene.

744
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:50,666
Walking an unleashed massif.

745
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,166
Animal fouling.

746
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:55,166
Four months.

747
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:57,166
Next.

748
00:44:58,416 --> 00:44:59,833
Keef Girgo?

749
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,708
Keef Girgo!

750
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:05,541
Here.

751
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:12,000
- Name?
- Hey, uh, Keef Girgo.

752
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:14,625
- Charges?
- Civil Disruption.

753
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:16,708
- Anti-Imperial speech.
- No. No.

754
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,208
Fleeing the scene
of anti-Imperial activity.

755
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:20,971
Attempted damage...

756
00:45:21,041 --> 00:45:23,666
- I... I'm sorry, there's something wrong.
- I wouldn't.

757
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,375
You've got enough trouble
without a Resisting Judgement charge.

758
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:27,750
I'm just a tourist.

759
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:30,125
Oh, apologies all around then.

760
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:32,000
This used to be a six-month sentence.

761
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:36,791
Six years.

762
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:38,416
- Six years?
- Six years?

763
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,767
- No, no, wait!
- Take him.

764
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:41,767
- Change of guidelines.
- Take him away.

765
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:44,375
- I didn't do anything! Hey!
- Take it up with the Emperor.

766
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:46,458
Wait. I'm just a tourist!

767
00:45:46,541 --> 00:45:48,166
- Next.
- Wait!
