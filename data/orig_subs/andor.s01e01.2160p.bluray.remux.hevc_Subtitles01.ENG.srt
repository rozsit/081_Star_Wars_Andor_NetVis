1
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:10,714
Wait there.

2
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,300
No weapons. No comms.

3
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,263
No credit. No nonsense.

4
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,347
In you go.

5
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,101
Upstairs lounge is closed tonight.

6
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,248
You pay at the end.

7
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,629
Don't even think about it.

8
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,214
She'll send you home cryin'.

9
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,853
Welcome.

10
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,730
Hello.

11
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:09,898
Alone tonight?

12
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,692
- Just me.
- Hmm.

13
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,360
- Have you been with us before?
- First time.

14
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,469
Well, you picked a great night.

15
00:03:16,494 --> 00:03:18,840
It's sort of been quiet this evening.

16
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,158
Excuse me.

17
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,660
We were here first.

18
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,037
Yeah, we've been waiting.
He just got here.

19
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,496
Gani will help you.

20
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,123
I don't want Gani.

21
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,792
Behave.

22
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,129
Oh, she's funny, ain't she?

23
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,966
My apologies.

24
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,860
You should take care of them.

25
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,553
Why?

26
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,762
It's a company town.

27
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,723
Oh, they're just sentry guards.

28
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,059
They like to play at being cops.
It's... It's annoying.

29
00:03:46,186 --> 00:03:48,394
- Hello, guys.
- Where were we?

30
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,397
You were telling me how quiet it was.

31
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,027
Looking for something special tonight?

32
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:01,407
A friend of mine said there was a girl
from Kenari working here.

33
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,492
Kenari?

34
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,328
It was a small Mid Rim system.

35
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,663
I've heard of it.

36
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,291
It's not your girlfriend or something,
is it?

37
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,335
I don't have a girlfriend.

38
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,339
Are you from Kenari? Nostalgic, are we?

39
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,552
Let me go and check on that for you.

40
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,768
Is there something amusing?

41
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,604
What?

42
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:33,398
You keep looking over here
like there's something funny.

43
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,651
Definitely not.

44
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,485
What does that mean?

45
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:44,200
Oh, that is a hard look
for a little thing like you.

46
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,120
Yeah, he's not laughing now, is he?

47
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,499
There was a girl from Kenari,
but she left several months ago.

48
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,169
We do have a lovely lady
here tonight from Tahina

49
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,672
who's got those big dark eyes
you're looking for.

50
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:00,091
This girl from Kenari,
any idea where she went?

51
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:05,471
What are you? Seriously.
Boyfriend? Husband?

52
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,767
I'm looking for my sister.

53
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,023
Well, whoever she is, she's not here.
She disappeared.

54
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,693
People come and go.

55
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:18,860
You should leave.

56
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,862
What was her name?

57
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,699
Nobody here gives their real name.

58
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,885
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on there.

59
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,262
No weapons. No comms.

60
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,640
No credit. No nonsense.

61
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,235
Hey! Scrawno! Slow down.

62
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:01,903
Slow down!

63
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,155
Stop! Stop right there!

64
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,076
You're in Pre-Mor corporate zone.
You know that, right?

65
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,913
Employees are required
to present their IDs upon request.

66
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,585
Oh, no, you didn't park
out past the causeway, did ya?

67
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,337
I sure hope not.
That's off-limits to visitors.

68
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,547
We'd have to fine you.

69
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,216
Yeah, I mean, you know
about the visitor's curfew, right?

70
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,761
Yeah, we'd have to impound your ride.

71
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,387
Tough break.

72
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,515
What if he swum over?

73
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,308
You swim over, scrawno?

74
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,645
Yeah, he's not laughing anymore.

75
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,480
If you've got Corpo ID,
now would be the time to pull it out.

76
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,107
Gonna have to see it, big stuff.

77
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,569
There you go.

78
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,949
I got 300 credits in my coat pocket.

79
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:52,078
What are the chances on that?

80
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,832
That is almost exactly what it costs
to cover the fine.

81
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,460
The towing charge
and our personal processing fee.

82
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,212
Everybody's lucky night.

83
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,551
Let's have a look at it.

84
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:06,718
I'm not moving.

85
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,388
You want it, you take
it and I walk away.

86
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,058
I don't need any surprises.

87
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:19,981
Have at it.

88
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,078
No. Other pocket.

89
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,012
Tell me now.

90
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,557
Tell me what to do!

91
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,184
Let's hear it, boss!

92
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,937
Get up. Get him up.

93
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:00,939
Get him up!

94
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:02,774
Move!

95
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,910
He's not breathing.

96
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,163
- No.
- Verlo! Verlo!

97
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,583
- He's faking.
- He's not!

98
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,878
Verlo!

99
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,509
You killed him.

100
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:42,773
You didn't mean it.

101
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,816
He fell.

102
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,319
We had a misunderstanding, and...

103
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,573
We'll go in together.

104
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,662
We played too hard in hitting,
and you didn't understand it.

105
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,624
He tried to grab you, and...
and he fell, and he hit his head.

106
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:03,919
We'll go in together.

107
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,087
We'll tell them what happened.

108
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,841
C-C-Cassian.
I brought what you t-t-told me.

109
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:20,055
Cassian. Kassa. Kassa.

110
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,641
Kassa! Kassa!

111
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,843
But where were you?

112
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,427
It's not important.

113
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,805
If it's not important, why not tell me?

114
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:47,643
Cassian?

115
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,853
Who came by the house last night?

116
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,939
Jezzi and Femmi brought supper
and Maarva's medicine,

117
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,400
and then Jezzi came back b-b-because...

118
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,652
Anybody looking for me?

119
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,362
B-B-Brasso. Brasso was looking for you.

120
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,031
What did you tell him?

121
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,118
Maarva told him...

122
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,286
Told him what?

123
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,789
Pausing for data lag.

124
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,582
Tell me what she said.

125
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,964
Bee!

126
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,505
Maarva said you were out
ruining your health and reputation

127
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,674
with friends of low character.

128
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,842
She told him sooner or later
you were going to

129
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,970
g-g-get yourself into trouble
you couldn't talk your way out of.

130
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,305
Then she told Brasso that...

131
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,389
Enough!

132
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,143
Come here.

133
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,689
Listen to me. It's important.

134
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:37,317
I know it takes a lot of energy,
but can you make a lie for me?

135
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,236
I can lie.
I have adequate power reserves.

136
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,949
Don't tell anybody you saw me.
Don't tell anybody you know where I am.

137
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,660
That's two lies.

138
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,994
Let's have both.

139
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,413
I will have to recharge at home.

140
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,124
Take your time on the way back.

141
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,212
I got to hurry.

142
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,922
I can't come with you?

143
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,049
Not now. I don't have time.

144
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,176
I'm sorry.

145
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,680
I'm late. Wait. What's this?

146
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,348
Hold still. Hold still.

147
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,603
Take your time.

148
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,379
Let's get to it.

149
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,800
- Grab mine.
- Yeah, grab those two now.

150
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:29,846
Brasso will catch you up.

151
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,931
Hey.

152
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,183
You don't look so good.

153
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,601
I'm fine.

154
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,353
- I came by for you last night.
- Yeah, I know.

155
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,397
What'd you do when you left?

156
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,694
Uh, I was tired. I went home, cleaned
up a bit, and then I fell asleep.

157
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:48,281
No. You came by for me,
but I wasn't there.

158
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,367
So then you started home,
and you saw me at the Hotel Bridge.

159
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,495
We decided we were thirsty,
and you wanted to go to Cavo's.

160
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,311
But I said that was no good because

161
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:58,249
there's too many people
there I owe money.

162
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,334
You're serious?

163
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,460
Yeah.

164
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,004
Who's gonna be asking?

165
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,798
So Cavo's was out.

166
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,275
But then you remembered you still had

167
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,761
half a bottle of nog stashed at home.

168
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,263
So we went there
and drank ourselves to sleep.

169
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,728
Please. I really need this.

170
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,568
You insulted my choice of beverage.

171
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,445
As host and provider,
I was offended by this.

172
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,575
You failed to gauge
the depth of my irritation.

173
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,744
You rose to make
your point more vocally.

174
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,496
I was helping you back
into your chair when you fell.

175
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,666
You were gone when I woke up.

176
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,752
You've come here now to apologize.

177
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,463
I accept your apology.

178
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,173
Hey, Brasso, let's go.

179
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:50,260
Do me this.
Whatever this is, when it's done,

180
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,304
pull your boots on and get to work.
You look like a wreck.

181
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,849
I knew I could count on you.

182
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,809
I'm not lending you any money.

183
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,060
I knew that, too.

184
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,814
Tell your mother she can afford
to put the heating on.

185
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:04,482
It was freezing there last night.

186
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,027
Make yourself useful.

187
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,046
This is quite the report.
This happened when?

188
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,507
Last night, sir.
I knew you were leaving this morning,

189
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,765
and I wanted to make sure you had all

190
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,968
the information before your departure.

191
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,386
You've been very busy.

192
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,971
Two men are dead, sir.

193
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,222
Employees.

194
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:39,350
If that's not worth staying up for,
then I'm not worthy of the uniform.

195
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,978
Have you modified your uniform?

196
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,773
Perhaps slightly.

197
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,232
Pockets, piping, and...

198
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,569
and some light tailoring.

199
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,574
I know one of these men. Kravas.

200
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:56,409
That's another reason I wanted this
to get immediate attention.

201
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,745
He was a squad commander on Four.

202
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,371
He's fallen a great deal since then.

203
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,082
He was a Sentry Corporal here on One.

204
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,291
No mystery there.

205
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,335
He's lucky he wasn't killed years ago.

206
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,796
One of the most unpleasant people
I've ever met.

207
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,756
There's no suspect at this point?

208
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,174
We have some excellent leads.

209
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,595
"A human with dark features
asking about a Kenari girl"

210
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,888
"who might have been working
in the establishment."

211
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:18,334
Are there no witnesses to the actual

212
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:20,402
crime? It's usually quite busy there.

213
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,061
Apparently not.
This happened just outside the district,

214
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,856
- at the plaza entrance to the causeway.
- I know.

215
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,191
- There's an intersection...
- I said I know it.

216
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,026
- Were they robbed?
- No, sir.

217
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,445
Tough case.

218
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:34,823
Bad timing.

219
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,284
I'm sure that in several days,
with the proper resources,

220
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,078
- I can bring this case to a...
- Stop!

221
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:43,665
And I don't mean just the talking.
I mean stop.

222
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,545
This case appears to bear
all the hallmarks

223
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:51,590
of what I like to describe
as regrettable misadventure.

224
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,008
Sir?

225
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,135
Two dedicated Pre-Mor employees

226
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:58,138
caught in the sad orbit
of a rare calamity.

227
00:18:58,764 --> 00:18:59,890
I don't understand.

228
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,475
I want you to conjure
a suitable accident.

229
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,060
- But...
- And let's make sure

230
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,778
it's on the far side of the plaza.

231
00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:07,438
Let's get it outside the Leisure Zone.

232
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:08,899
- But they were murdered.
- No.

233
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,734
They were killed in a fight.

234
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:14,029
They were in a brothel,
which we're not supposed to have,

235
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,532
the expensive one,
which they shouldn't be able to afford,

236
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:19,367
drinking Revnog,
which we're not supposed to allow.

237
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,789
Both of them supposedly on the job,
which is a dismissible offense.

238
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,583
They clearly harassed
a human with dark features

239
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,627
and chose the wrong person to annoy.

240
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:34,424
I suspect they died rushing
to aid someone in distress.

241
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,760
Nothing too heroic.
We don't need a parade.

242
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,763
They died being helpful.

243
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:43,559
Something sad but inspiring
in a mundane sort of way.

244
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,481
You look stricken, Deputy Inspector.

245
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:53,026
Are you absorbing my meaning here?

246
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,945
Trying, sir.

247
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,573
When I said bad timing,

248
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:01,117
I wasn't referring to the fact
that you spent all night worrying this.

249
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:04,120
I meant that
I am on my way this very morning

250
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,373
to an Imperial Regional Command review,

251
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:11,211
where I'll be asked to make a report
about our crime rates,

252
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,129
and the goal of that speech,

253
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:16,466
should you ever be asked to deliver it,
is brevity.

254
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:21,429
Minimizing the time the Empire spends
thinking about Preox-Morlana

255
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:24,390
benefits our superiors
and, by extension,

256
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:28,095
everyone here
at the Pre-Mor Security Inspection team,

257
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:31,565
which at the moment includes you.

258
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,152
Don't put your feet on my desk
in my absence,

259
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,155
and let's have an accident
report waiting when I get back.

260
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,839
Yeah, tell him that 15,000
is the best he's gonna get.

261
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,261
She's in the yard.

262
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,557
Yes, Yes, we can do that.

263
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:21,948
I'm busy.

264
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:23,784
I'll be quick.

265
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,831
What?

266
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,000
- Your friend.
- What friend?

267
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,671
The one who buys. Your secret friend.
How fast can you reach him?

268
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:36,838
What happened to you?

269
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,464
I fell.

270
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:40,341
On what? A jealous husband?

271
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,636
I have something to sell.

272
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,429
Don't we all?

273
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:45,764
How soon could he be here?

274
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,141
I was planning to reach out
at the end of the month.

275
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,937
No. This would have to be now.

276
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,855
Yeah, for what? For one item?

277
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:57,192
No. That's not how it works.
I bundle things before I make contact.

278
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,069
Bix. Bix. Come on.

279
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:05,450
There's a Tac Corvette coming
in this week looking for scrap.

280
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:07,786
I'm told there's a rack
of Imperial targeting units

281
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,871
someone might forget to strip out.

282
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:12,123
We'll get that, that thing you've got.

283
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,458
Got a few Naval com-scans...

284
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,126
- I can't wait that long.
- Why?

285
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,005
What have you done?

286
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,551
Your friend will want this piece.

287
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:25,386
He'll come for this.
You said he wanted to meet me.

288
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,471
So, what is it?

289
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:28,932
What is it?

290
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:34,020
I got an untraceable NS-9 Starpath unit.

291
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:38,108
Vector crystals and Imperial seal
still intact.

292
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,568
How long have you had that?

293
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,237
I need to move it, Bix.

294
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,780
- You've been hiding it.
- Saving it.

295
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,741
I'm guessing it comes
from one of my bids.

296
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:48,076
- Guess again.
- Not your best move, Cassian.

297
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:52,623
So, what?

298
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:54,875
You want to call your guy or not?

299
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,877
- Do you know how much that's worth?
- Yeah.

300
00:22:57,628 --> 00:23:00,506
Enough to get out of here,
lay low till things cool off.

301
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,717
- I need to relocate for a while.
- You've been holding out on me.

302
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,386
And you've been skimming off the top.

303
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,304
So let's not get emotional.

304
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:12,893
You'll need an alternative plan...

305
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:14,256
No, no. The answer's no.

306
00:23:14,281 --> 00:23:15,787
You don't know what
I'm about to suggest.

307
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,731
- I'm not selling this to you, Bix.
- Come on.

308
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,650
I didn't hang on to this
to have a partner.

309
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,652
I need every credit
I can put my hands on to...

310
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,820
Are we bidding on the
Wobani run tomorrow?

311
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,072
What?

312
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:29,284
There's a Wobani run coming.
Jeef wants to know if we're in on it.

313
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:31,870
He'll know when I'm ready.

314
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,671
Yeah, are you...

315
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,255
What?

316
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:46,593
Well, it looks like it's turned
into something more than work.

317
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,303
Do I ask about your personal life?

318
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:51,389
Just promise he knows nothing
about any of this.

319
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,141
He'd do anything for me.

320
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,186
No. No, no. That wasn't my question.

321
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:01,024
No. He knows nothing about any of it.

322
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:10,951
Bix, you said he wanted to meet me.

323
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,286
I really need this.

324
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,168
I'll let him know.

325
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:26,633
Now, go fix your face.

326
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,681
Four of these, five of these.
Transport at once, once we get payment.

327
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:34,057
Mm-hmm.

328
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,475
She seems upset.

329
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,811
It's good to see you, Timm.

330
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,396
Seems like that happens
every time you come around.

331
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,483
I wouldn't worry.
She's tougher than both of us.

332
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,485
I'm getting tired of hearing that.

333
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:50,115
Then you'd better find yourself
a less-complicated woman.

334
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,324
Good luck with that.

335
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,073
Kassa!

336
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,867
Ey!

337
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,195
Everything okay, sir?

338
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,404
Fine.

339
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:55,323
Thank you.

340
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:07,503
Forward.

341
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:09,921
Forward.

342
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,090
Forward.

343
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:16,344
Wait. Wait, wait. Go
back. Go back. That.

344
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:19,848
What is that?

345
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,979
I'm not quite sure, sir.

346
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,397
Sublight something.

347
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:32,235
Orlean Star Cab or a Dayvan.
Some old thing.

348
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:35,071
And this something just strolls
through the checkpoint?

349
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:39,409
No identification whatsoever,
just wanders into points unknown?

350
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:44,039
The nights get busy.
You know the traffic.

351
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:46,750
I don't know what's more disturbing,

352
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:50,086
the fact our borders are unprotected
or your complacence about it.

353
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:54,340
Find it. Whatever it is, I want to know
when it left and where it went.

354
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:56,510
You'd have to filter the entire night.

355
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:59,805
Well, if it's too much for you,
let me know.

356
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:01,389
I'm sure somebody wants the chair.

357
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:14,277
- Hey, Cass.
- Hey.

358
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,779
- Good to see...
- What's the hurry?

359
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,238
- Got some place to be?
- Yeah.

360
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:18,907
What, not happy to see me?

361
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,367
- What, no love for Nurchi?
- No, I'm late, okay?

362
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:23,704
I know. I want my deposit back.

363
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:26,748
I wish I could, but it's in play.

364
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:28,792
Just waiting to hear they're on-site.
Okay?

365
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:32,462
Vetch?

366
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,881
Seriously?

367
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:36,967
I'm not one of these losers
gonna let you float

368
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,219
until they forget how much you owe them.

369
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:41,429
You're here with him.

370
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:43,682
To what?

371
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:45,183
To threaten me?

372
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:49,229
Vetch, you let him talk you into this?

373
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:50,396
The subject is money.

374
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,357
- I just asked you a question.
- What?

375
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,400
Since when do you
take orders from Nurchi?

376
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:55,569
Don't answer that.

377
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:00,657
- You need work this bad?
- Leave him out of it.

378
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:03,577
He said all I needed
to do was stand here.

379
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:05,286
Good.

380
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,496
You keep at it.

381
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,873
You think I'm messing around?

382
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:08,999
I hope so.

383
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:12,168
I'm gonna do us a favor
and not mention this happened.

384
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:15,046
Vetch, very nice to see you.

385
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,511
What?

386
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:25,516
I'll be back.

387
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:29,227
- What's up?
- Errands. Won't be long.

388
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:41,299
Dad.

389
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,553
Haven't seen you lately.

390
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:45,637
Some of us work.

391
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:47,889
What are we looking for?

392
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,141
Bendine Mesh-Tech filter.

393
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,314
Yellow racks in the back.

394
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:58,650
You might have to dig a little.

395
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,402
- Thanks.
- Good luck with it.

396
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:56,416
Look alive. He's on his way up.

397
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,669
Is he even allowed to approve overtime?

398
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:00,671
- That's his problem.
- Not if we don't get it.

399
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:02,714
Well, it'll be his
name in the time scan.

400
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:05,091
- Ferrix!
- Yes, sir, we've been working on it.

401
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:07,302
Kenari human males on Ferrix.

402
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:09,054
I'm afraid that's a blank, sir.

403
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,138
What?

404
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:11,765
But we have got a Imperial census.

405
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:12,849
How old is it?

406
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,225
This is six years ago.

407
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:15,310
That's an eternity.

408
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:18,021
There's not a lot about Kenari, sir.
It's fairly obscure.

409
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:19,272
That should make it easier.

410
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,232
We'll have to put the word out.

411
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,318
- On Ferrix?
- Where else would we put it?

412
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:25,028
We don't have presence there, sir.

413
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,238
- Is it not under our jurisdiction?
- Technically.

414
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:28,990
We are simply asking for information.

415
00:32:29,015 --> 00:32:30,277
Have you ever been there?

416
00:32:30,302 --> 00:32:31,644
What difference does that make?

417
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:33,745
They have their own way of doing things.

418
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:36,497
This is the murder
of two Pre-Mor employees!

419
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,044
Put out a bulletin.

420
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:44,715
Kenari human men wanted for questioning.
Slam their channels. Flood it.

421
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:47,175
Set up a desk here
to monitor anything that comes in.

422
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:49,553
Let's go!

423
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:25,964
- What do you think you're doing?
- Forgot something.

424
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:28,466
Now? He's in the office.

425
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:32,428
I refueled it. Just like you told me.
And now I'm almost done.

426
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:35,849
What is that? Is that the ID chip log?

427
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:36,933
It's the old one.

428
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:39,853
I'm just putting a blank in right now.

429
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:43,189
Pegla! Pegla!

430
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:45,400
What in the name of Chobb
is going on out there?

431
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,821
I think the yard rats are back.

432
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:51,865
There's a customer out front.

433
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:54,367
Get those hounds
to start earning their keep.

434
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,247
Why are you swapping chip logs?
You're gonna get us both in trouble.

435
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,667
I didn't like the way
it was running last night.

436
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,251
So you're doing me a favor?

437
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:05,045
Leave it better than you found it.

438
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,296
The way you always do.

439
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:08,464
The Cassian way.

440
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:12,260
I was gonna ask if I could
borrow it again tomorrow.

441
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,095
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

442
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,681
Close this out.

443
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:16,765
Don't come back.

444
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:18,850
- Come on, Pegla.
- No, no, no.

445
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,061
No.

446
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:24,230
We're done. No more
favors. No more deals.

447
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:26,399
- Listen, this...
- Don't.

448
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:29,820
I don't want to know
what you're doing or why

449
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:32,531
or where you took this thing last night
or any of it.

450
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:34,616
Finish up. Get out.

451
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:37,368
Don't come back.

452
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:19,244
Kassa.
