00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,791
<i>to tour the showrooms
and brokerages</i>

322
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:13,791
<i>of this peaceful and
elegant metropolis.</i>

323
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:16,791
<i>"Ghorman pride" is a
term you'll often hear.</i>

324
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:19,291
<i>And it will only take you
a few hours on the ground</i>

325
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:21,772
<i>- to understand the source of that term.</i>
- [Krennic] Thank you.

326
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,000
Ghorman...

327
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:29,625
is of great interest
to the Empire.

328
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:33,791
[Cassian] What happened
to my ship? It's ruined.

329
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,125
[Bardi] Hold him. Get his feet.

330
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,550
- [Cassian] Where's Porko?
- [Gerdis] Shut up.

331
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,416
[Cassian] Somebody tell
me what's going on here.

332
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:42,017
- [Gerdis] Somebody hit him.
- [grunting]

333
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,707
- Who are you?
- Who is he?

334
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,707
- He's an Impy pilot.
- Can I just do this, please?

335
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:52,791
Then do it.

336
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:54,374
- Who are...
- Let's see. We're waiting.

337
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:57,615
- [Gerdis] Let me know when you're done.
- I'm here to meet a friend. Where is he?

338
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:00,666
- We ask the questions.
- Wow.

339
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,374
Big move. Now you can
ask him who he is.

340
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,041
Maybe I'll get an answer.

341
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:05,667
That's a stolen ship.

342
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,833
There was another pilot here,
waiting to take it forward.

343
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,124
Stolen for who?

344
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:13,083
- For the Rebellion.
- Whose rebellion?

345
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:17,000
Where is the pilot
I'm supposed to meet?

346
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:21,499
- Where is he?
- Your friend was not friendly.

347
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,208
He took a shot at us.
Tried to make a run for it.

348
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,291
Big mistake.

349
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:28,000
[Rika] He's lying anyway.

350
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,458
- This guy is a test pilot.
- [all groan]

351
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:39,041
[Krennic] I doubt anyone here is
unaware of the difficulties we've had

352
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:43,499
making the Emperor's dream of
energy independence a reality.

353
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,832
Now, I hear the rumors.
I know the stories.

354
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,499
Delays. Setbacks.

355
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,333
Groveling for Senate funding.

356
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:53,958
I met with the
Emperor yesterday.

357
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:58,207
And he suggested, I remind
you that the Energy Initiative

358
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:01,208
remains the centerpiece
of his agenda.

359
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:06,082
Access to stable,
unlimited power

360
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:08,916
will transform the
galactic economy

361
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:12,124
and solidify Imperial authority.

362
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,457
And it turns out,

363
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:19,458
spiders are not the most
unique thing in Ghorman.

364
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:23,000
There's a mineral
underground. Doctor?

365
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:27,499
Deep substrate foliated Kalkite.

366
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,583
[Krennic] Kalkite.

367
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:33,582
Synthetic Kalkite.
Kalkite alternatives.

368
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:35,499
Kalkite substitutes.

369
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,374
I mean, the amount of time spent
pondering this grubby little bit of rock

370
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,042
is sadly astonishing.

371
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:43,999
Now, we've promised
delivery in three years.

372
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,624
That delivery is dependent on
some version of Ghorman Kalkite

373
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:51,042
to coat the reactor lenses.

374
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:53,417
Now...

375
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,750
should we fail to
find any alternatives,

376
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:03,082
we will have to control Ghorman
with a hand firm enough...

377
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,916
[whispers] ...to silence... [in
normal voice] ...any resistance,

378
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:08,332
and you've been selected

379
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:11,625
to help plan for
that possibility.

380
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:18,124
[Rika] There are lights on but there
is no power. I don't understand.

381
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,791
[Bardi] This should
not be that difficult.

382
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,957
- [Rika] Where is the power coming from?
- [flicking switch]

383
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:23,041
[Bardi] Maybe on that side.

384
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:24,207
- [Rika] Bardi.
- [Bardi] Right.

385
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:25,916
- Please...
- [Bardi] Will you be able to do it?

386
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,833
Nothing's where
it's supposed to be.

387
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:32,333
[Cassian] I wouldn't touch that.

388
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,083
- [Bardi] What is it?
- I'm not sure.

389
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:37,582
What is that?

390
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:38,707
No clue.

391
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:40,208
So, how did you get here?

392
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:42,542
I guess it's my
lucky day. [scoffs]

393
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:44,916
You think this is funny?

394
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:48,000
Listen. There is
no manual. Okay?

395
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:51,082
Hey, we're trying to focus here.

396
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,624
What do you think?
Can you fly it?

397
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,124
[woman] I don't know.
[sighs] It's all new.

398
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,832
[Gerdis] He can fly it.

399
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,875
We need all the room we can get.

400
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,542
Do the math. We don't all fit.

401
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:06,832
Is there anything
to eat in there?

402
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,207
- [Bardi] No!
- [woman] No!

403
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:11,624
The Kalkite extraction. I'm
assuming it's an invasive process.

404
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:15,582
It would present stark challenges
to the local population.

405
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:16,792
Meaning what?

406
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:21,958
The extent of our withdrawal
may render the planet unstable.

407
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:24,833
It's gouge mining.

408
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:28,208
There would be stress
on the planet's core.

409
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,124
There is a risk
of... total collapse.

410
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,375
[Admiral Daysar] Nine cities.

411
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,374
Eight-hundred thousand Ghormans.

412
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:40,541
[Krennic] Well,
relocation would be ideal.

413
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:42,791
But we need to plan
for alternatives,

414
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:45,332
all of which will
require preparation.

415
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:48,292
[Partagaz] Ghorman is neither
obscure nor without political power.

416
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:51,124
They will not go quietly.

417
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,417
Which is exactly
why you're here.

418
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:57,374
[Bardi] If Rika says
she can fly it, she can.

419
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,499
She's not saying that. I...
I don't hear you saying that.

420
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,791
- It's confusing.
- He's gotta teach her.

421
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:03,000
Why would he do that?

422
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:05,042
If he doesn't, we'll kill him.

423
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:08,291
- [Gerdis] That's your plan?
- [Bardi] He's gotta know we mean business.

424
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:09,917
You'd never make it.

425
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,207
Alone? No. No way.

426
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:14,582
[Bardi] We're in charge.
We call the shots.

427
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:17,292
But the two of us, we could
be out of here by now.

428
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,416
[Gerdis] Having Rika kill us

429
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:21,083
- on take-off is not a plan.
- [scoffs]

430
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,624
[Bardi] She just
needs some basics.

431
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,749
He can't teach her if he's dead.
Everything with you is negative.

432
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,416
[Gerdis] Like killing
the only pilot we have?

433
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:29,749
Well, we gotta have one of 'em.

434
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,166
She just needs a little time.

435
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:33,124
- [Plug] How long will it take?
- And where do we go?

436
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,291
So, what is it?

437
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,166
- [Rika] Well, we can't stay here.
- Do they really trust you?

438
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:39,125
Or they just think
you're stupid?

439
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:43,167
You know I don't need
an excuse to hit you.

440
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:45,042
I get it.

441
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:47,292
Two days, no food.

442
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:49,416
Makes everyone cranky, right?

443
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:51,292
How do you know how
long we've been here?

444
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:54,874
- Hmm?
- [scoffs]

445
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:57,417
You were not here three
days ago when I left.

446
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:03,249
- We still have the same problem.
- [Flek] He's right.

447
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,041
- Who goes and who stays?
- We make trips.

448
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:07,208
- And who goes first?
- There it is.

449
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:11,499
Right there. There's
our real problem.

450
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,542
- Me?
- The lack of trust.

451
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:18,249
Your brother dumped us here and ran
away, and you wanna talk about trust?

452
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,416
- He went back for survivors.
- Nobody believes that.

453
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:23,542
Rika, Neek, Nazy, Rowd...

454
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:26,708
- Oh, we know what really happened.
- [Cassian] Maya Pei.

455
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,249
You're the Maya Pei Brigade.

456
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,874
What? What did you tell him?

457
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:33,291
- This is on you.
- Crab?

458
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:35,791
- What's the rub? He can see we're stuck.
- [chuckling] I know Maya.

459
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,082
- Maya's dead.
- According to you.

460
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,832
- Only he saw her.
- I was trying to save her.

461
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,666
We got ambushed. We lost
6 ships, 40 fighters.

462
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,832
- My brother was the only who...
- Your brother ran away!

463
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:44,875
- How do you know Maya?
- She was a customer.

464
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:48,124
We've been supplying
you along the way.

465
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:52,082
[pants] Argue all you want, but
we're all part of the same rebellion.

466
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:53,166
Your friend was hostile.

467
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:55,707
He was on a mission. [scoffs]

468
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:57,582
We're stealing an
Imperial test ship.

469
00:32:57,583 --> 00:33:00,083
- For who? Who are you with?
- [pants]

470
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,417
I'm not telling you that.

471
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,208
We told you.

472
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:08,583
Yeah, well, you should
be more careful.

473
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:11,207
You scobbing jack pad!

474
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,291
- No, no, no!
- No. No. No.

475
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:13,374
- Hey, stop!
- Stop it!

476
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,499
Crab, you gotta stop it!

477
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,624
We're not here to... to
gloss over any difficulties.

478
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:23,458
The suppression of Ghorman is not
a decision to be taken lightly.

479
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:27,375
This is not our first
meeting on the subject.

480
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:31,082
Dee Shambo, Nisus Osar

481
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,957
will be our partners from the
Ministry of Enlightenment.

482
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,542
- Gentlemen...
- Thank you, Director. [clears throat]

483
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:46,375
Some of what you're thinking about
Ghormans at this very moment exists

484
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,124
because we put it there.

485
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:53,000
Hasn't there always been something
slightly arrogant about the Ghor?

486
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:55,207
Oh, we all feel
it. What is that?

487
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:58,207
Last year, when the shipping
lanes had to be shut down,

488
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:02,291
how hard would it have been to
simply allow the Imperial inspections

489
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,874
that most other planets welcome?

490
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,708
And didn't it seem as if the Ghor
were doing what they always do?

491
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:10,542
Putting themselves first.

492
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:12,874
Did a dedicated
Imperial Naval Inspector

493
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,208
really have to die to
protect Ghorman pride?

494
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,167
We did that.

495
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:21,874
We made the story. We
shaped it. We blew it up.

496
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,667
We decided when it was over.

497
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:27,291
With the right ideas
planted in the right market,

498
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:28,958
in the right sequence,

499
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:33,082
we can now weaponize
this galactic opinion.

500
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,374
[Osar] Now, we love the spiders.

501
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:36,041
Oh. Oh, it's an image
we can build on.

502
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:38,041
Aggressive, unpleasant,
keeping to themselves.

503
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,749
Now, is it just coincidence
that the Ghorman personality

504
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,291
seems so in tune
with these creatures?

505
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:46,874
The secrecy, the overcharging,
mocking Imperial protocols.

506
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,624
- Laughing at us...
- Okay.

507
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:52,167
Yep. We, uh... We get the idea.

508
00:34:57,042 --> 00:34:59,499
[clicks tongue] You're
wasting daylight.

509
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,000
There must be food and
water out there somewhere.

510
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,666
- There's beasts out there.
- No talking.

511
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,250
I don't take orders from Bardi.

512
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:10,000
What kind of beasts?

513
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:11,958
You'll hear 'em tonight.

514
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:15,250
[chuckles softly]

515
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,332
- [Gerdis] I'm not saying I trust him.
- Supposed to be an intake gauge.

516
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,457
- But you'd let him fly us.
- If that's the only choice.

517
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:22,978
Once we're in the
air, he's in control.

518
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:24,999
- Why are there two?
- You're not getting anywhere.

519
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,999
You're not letting her concentrate!
Rika has to learn how to fly this plane.

520
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,083
Well, she's not...

521
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:31,708
So, who's really in charge here?

522
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:34,125
[all scream]

523
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,083
[animals screeching]

524
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:44,082
It's harder than it looks.

525
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,583
[Gerdis] Are you insane?

526
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,083
Why not have a plague? Or
stage some natural disaster?

527
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:59,374
That'd motivate them to leave
the place of their own accord.

528
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,499
We've actually gamed that out.

529
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,667
It gets unpredictable
very quickly.

530
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:07,041
The drilling equipment's
being assembled now

531
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:08,957
and warehoused for
transport when needed.

532
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:12,457
And once that's all ready,
how quickly can you mobilize?

533
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,125
- Once we're tucked away...
- Mmm.

534
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:18,500
...the drilling is easy. We can be
up and running in a matter of weeks.

535
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,625
[breathes deeply]

536
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:26,291
It's the administration and
security issues that are troubling.

537
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:29,291
We don't have a large presence
on Ghorman at the moment.

538
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:30,625
He's planned for that.

539
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:33,833
We're building a
new armory in Palmo.

540
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,541
Excuse me?

541
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,250
We're starting tomorrow.

542
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:55,917
You're awfully
quiet, aren't you?

543
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,708
- It's a lot to take in.
- [Krennic inhales] Oh!

544
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:03,167
I heard you learn quickly.

545
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,542
I like to know what
I'm talking about.

546
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,832
You're here at my request.

547
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:14,666
I don't get to Coruscant
much these days,

548
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,917
but I do keep my
ear to the ground.

549
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:23,375
Now, some people might not have
recovered from an incident like Ferrix.

550
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:28,207
You're not inspired by the
anti-Ghorman whispering campaign?

551
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,083
I'm still forming an opinion.

552
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,250
Piece of advice.

553
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,707
You think you're hard to read?
You need to get over that.

554
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:38,749
Now you have a plan already. You had
it before they finished speaking.

555
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,167
I want your assessment.

556
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,750
- [sighs]
- Propaganda will only get you so far.

557
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,083
You need a radical
insurgency you can count on.

558
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:53,042
Count on for what?

559
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,875
You need Ghorman rebels you can
depend on to do the wrong thing...

560
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:00,792
Director.

[B2EMO whines]

00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:42,041
I spoke to Kellen. He said they
haven't done this in years.

569
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:44,166
I've been here for eight.
I've never seen it.

What are they doing?

571
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:49,208
An Imperial Supply Census.
It's an audit. A spot check.

572
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:51,874
They wanna know what they've
got, where it's coming from.

573
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:53,791
- What about who's doing it?
- [Brasso] He's asking.

574
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:56,207
I guess right now, they're
focused on Council Five Hundred.

575
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,666
That's what we saw
out there today.

576
00:38:57,667 --> 00:38:59,457
If they're checking
visas, we have a problem.

577

- He knows that.
- It's gonna be fine.

No one here is about to

630
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,750
Is Marni joining you?

631
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,083
We're living apart
at the moment.

632
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:38,500
I'm surprised you haven't heard.

633
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,875
- I have not.
- Hmm.

634
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:48,250
So much for the gossiping
biddies of Chandrila.

635
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,125
It's a recent development.

636
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:02,124
[clicks tongue] And it's not what
I wanted to talk to you about.

637
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,957
I know you said
you got my message.

638
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:07,083
I was hoping we could
discuss the Foundation.

639
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:13,875
Is there a problem?

640
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:15,958
[smacks lips] Not like that. No.

641
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:18,542
[Runai] Oh, Mon. There you are.

642
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,792
- Hello, Tay. Yeah.
- Hello.

643
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,791
- They've had their first fight.
- Oh, dear.

644
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:26,500
Hmm. Leida's run off.

645
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:30,582
- You'll have to excuse me.
- Of course.

646
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:32,292
We'll find time together.

647
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,957
[Runai] Davo just told
me about you and Marni...

648
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:40,042
[server] Thank you.

649
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,667
- [Leida whimpering]
- Leida...

650
00:43:51,292 --> 00:43:52,292
Oh...

651
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:55,875
[sniffles]

652
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:58,167
Darling.

653
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:00,667
What's happened?

654
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:04,458
[crying] He's a child.

655
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:07,333
Tell me.

656
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:09,500
What happened?

657
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:12,583
He won't hold my hand.

658
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:15,792
I keep trying and he
keeps pushing me away.

659
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,458
I'm sorry.

660
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:28,208
So...

661
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,042
terribly sorry.

662
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:42,292
[animals screeching]

663
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:48,249
[Bardi] It has been two days.
He could've been captured.

664
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,457
He could've run away.

665
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:52,166
[Gerdis] What you are
talking about is a mutiny.

666
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:53,916
It's not a mutiny if
no one's in charge.

667
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:56,249
[chuckles] I was always
Maya's number two.

668
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,999
- In your dreams!
- I was always

669
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,416
- supposed to be in charge.
- I ain't never heard that.

670
00:45:00,417 --> 00:45:02,791
- 'Cause you never listen, skug.
- I wanna hear it from Maya.

671
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:05,374
- That might take a while.
- She's dead.

672
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:07,499
- [Nazy] She's not.
- You saw nothing.

673
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,374
- You were hiding in the bunker.
- That's a lie.

674
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:11,624
- I saw you.
- Yeah, you tell him, Rika.

675
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,707
Step off, Rowd!

676
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:15,499
Maya comes back and we're not here,
there's gonna be noise about it.

677
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,791
- You take it back.
- Get stuffed!

678
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:19,957
- See what you've done?
- Your brother stole our ship.

679
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:21,124
Say it again!

680
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:23,417
- [all exclaim]
- [Nazy] Bad idea, Crab.

681
00:45:24,042 --> 00:45:25,416
Tell him to put it down.

682
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:27,207
Crab, come on, man.

683
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:28,874
- He took off...
- [man] You're a cheater!

684
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:29,957
[man 2] Easy, easy.

685
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:31,042
[Crab] Call me a liar.

686
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:33,583
You're not even good at that.

687
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:34,874
[grunts]

688
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:36,207
- Skug!
- [man 3] Why?

689
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,082
- Why'd you do that?
- Go. Go, go, go!

690
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:39,791
[woman] Go! Go, go, go!

691
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:41,542
[man 3] Drop it,
drop it! Drop it!

692
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,583
- Stay down!
- [gasping]

693
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,458
- [man 4] Run. Run!
- [all shouting indistinctly]

694
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:52,708
[man 3] All right, get him up!
Get him up! Come on, come on!

695
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:00,875
[♪ dramatic music playing]

696
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,083
