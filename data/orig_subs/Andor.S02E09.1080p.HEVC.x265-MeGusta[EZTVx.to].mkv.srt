1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,146
If it's a war, and you keep saying it is,

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,726
it's not up to us what
we save, what we lose...

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,130
But if I'm giving up
everything, I want to win.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,476
I thought you were a local boy.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,830
My father's chandrilan.
I was born in Naboo.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,420
My mother's ghorman.

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,460
Bounced around until she passed
away, and then mon stepped in.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,766
Ghorman needs this
legislation more than anyone.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,226
I am constantly begging
my people to stay calm

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,540
<i>and do nothing that
might make things worse.</i>

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,556
They're finally wanting to do something

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,856
<i>and you tell them to be careful.</i>

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,936
<i>You're thinking small.
You're thinking like a thief.</i>

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,556
I'm thinking like a soldier.

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,000
Think like a leader.

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,976
Tell me what you saw.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,330
I sense the weight of
things, things I can't see.

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,300
He's a messenger.

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,396
I'm meeting with tay next week.

20
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,106
I'll warn him off. I'll find what it takes.

21
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,300
- I'll get a number.
- You know the number.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,766
We'd be vulnerable forever.
You need to be protected.

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,540
I'm not sure what you're saying.

24
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,420
How nice for you.

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,436
Luthen wants to know
if you're ready to work.

26
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,896
What does he need me for?

27
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,896
Isb supervisor, dedra meero.

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,562
<i>She's there in ghorman,
waiting to be killed.</i>

29
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:13,896
- What's all this?
- It's a personal trip.

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,646
That is unacceptable, and you know it.

31
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,896
All set.

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,556
They're on the verge of promoting him,

33
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,686
and then he goes and does
something like this morning.

34
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,356
He'll be there when you need him.

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,396
Think about a planet
like ghorman in rebellion.

36
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,380
<i>A planet of wealth and status.</i>

37
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,630
And if it goes up in flames?

38
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,106
It will burn... very brightly.

39
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,500
Open fire!

40
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,646
This is palmo one.

41
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,306
<i>We are under siege.
We're being slaughtered.</i>

42
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,646
<i>The imperial murder
of ghorman has begun.</i>

43
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,106
<i>As I say these words,</i>

44
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,356
<i>hundreds of murdered
ghorman lay dead in palmo Plaza.</i>

45
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,766
<i>Thousands more on the streets.</i>

46
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,516
More every minute.

47
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,160
<i>We're being destroyed!</i>

48
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,580
Who are you?

49
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,016
- If you can...
- If you can hear me...

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,606
<i>If you believe in truth, if
you have any faith left in truth,</i>

51
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,010
<i>please, please Mark this
message and pass it forward.</i>

52
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,500
Help us!

53
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,840
<i>Is there no one who can help us?</i>

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,210
Is there no one?

55
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,646
I am a senator! With the
full rights and protections...

56
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,726
What's going on?

57
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,556
- Ambassador oran...
- He's being arrested.

58
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,186
- Stand back and get your arms off!
- What?

59
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,016
- Stormtroopers!
- In the senate!

60
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,646
No warrant! No charges!

61
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,500
This is the senate chamber,
I have every right to be here.

62
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,710
Will no one help me?
Ghorman is being slaughtered!

63
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,620
It's my people today and yours tomorrow!

64
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,420
Remember this day!
Remember ghorman!

65
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,550
This will be you soon enough.

66
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,000
Remember this day!

67
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,146
Have you seen the
numbers? The ghorman dead?

68
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,856
It's beyond belief.

69
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,522
Don't put on the imperial news.

70
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:26,976
- I've seen it. It's insane.
- The winner writes the story.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,330
Well, they haven't won yet.

72
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,056
I need to make a speech tomorrow.

73
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,726
They'll never let you take the floor.

74
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,016
Well, I've seen you work miracles before.

75
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,580
Has to be done, bail.
I can't take it anymore.

76
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,590
And yes, I know there's no
telling what the emperor's...

77
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,540
Capable of at this...

78
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,476
At this point, anything is possible.

79
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,556
But they've gone too
far and we all know it.

80
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,290
We need to speak out. We need
to stand up, and speak the truth,

81
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,686
and then we need to leave. Both of us.

82
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,806
We need an exit plan, and we need to
make it now while we still have the time.

83
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,290
We have a plan. That's not the issue.

84
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,357
Then what is it?

85
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:03,340
I'm not going anywhere.

86
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,686
- Are you telling me to be silent?
- It's not like that.

87
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,806
Senator.

88
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,436
We talked about this. What
might happen. If this isn't the limit,

89
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,766
- then what is?
- It's not so easy.

90
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,766
Compared to what? Nothing we will ever do
will be as hard as hiding all these years.

91
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,870
Mon.

92
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,686
It's not that... at all.

93
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,790
It's me.

94
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,660
I have to stay. We have to buy time.

95
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,226
We're not ready. Yavin isn't ready.

96
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,750
We need to stall.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,330
But you're right,
something needs to be said.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,500
And yavin needs your
leadership. I just can't go with you.

99
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,910
Not yet.

100
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,500
You'd be a hostage.

101
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,460
Let's hope not.

102
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,460
Work on the speech, and be very careful.

103
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,670
Senator ton found a
listening device in her office.

104
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,726
And tell no one.

105
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,936
Be ready to leave the
moment you're done.

106
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,380
And be very careful.

107
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,300
They're calling an early
session at the senate.

108
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,500
If she speaks, we need to be ready...

109
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,710
So we're keeping you a journalist.

110
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,710
It's perfect.

111
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,620
Ronnie googe, mid-rim network.

112
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,556
You're coming straight
from the ghorman massacre

113
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,250
to cover the political fallout.

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,186
There's a senate
catering entrance we like.

115
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,056
These credentials will work inside, but
they scan for weapons at the entrance.

116
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,556
You'll wanna hang on to this one.

117
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,290
It's a surface pass, it's good all season.

118
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,670
I won't be needing it.

119
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,040
I'm not coming back.

120
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,880
I'm done after this.

121
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,500
Are you?

122
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,080
What does that mean?

123
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,250
Done?

124
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,420
Done with what? With us? With all of it?

125
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,790
He'll know what it means.

126
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,562
So, it's a private thing,
something I wouldn't understand.

127
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,580
- I didn't say that.
- Can I guess?

128
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,960
You're tired. It's too much. It's too hard.

129
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,686
You were a witness to
the ghorman massacre,

130
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,540
one would think there'd
be no stopping you.

131
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,646
The senator you'll be saving
is about to risk everything

132
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,840
putting a voice to the
atrocity you just survived.

133
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,210
Tell her you're "done."

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
When have I not come through?

135
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,920
I need to start making my own decisions.

136
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,210
I thought that's what we were fighting for.

137
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,750
Clean yourself up.

138
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,160
I'll find you some clothes.

139
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,210
I need to keep looking.

140
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,160
We have to be sure.

141
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,130
I need to practice the speech.

142
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,000
Not here. Not yet.

143
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,040
Get some air. Go to the Plaza.

144
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,090
It's not on our end.

145
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,920
So it just went dead?

146
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,960
The death of truth is
the ultimate victory of evil.

147
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,290
When truth leaves us...

148
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,090
When it is ripped from our hands,

149
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:39,040
vulnerable to the appetite of
whatever monster screams the loudest...

150
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,630
How did you know I would be here?

151
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,710
Erskin Semaj works for me.

152
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,880
He wanted to tell you
himself, but here we are.

153
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,040
All this time?

154
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,330
He's protected you in
ways you'll never know.

155
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,710
Well, isn't that wonderfully cryptic?

156
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,630
Who else am I trusting that I shouldn't?

157
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,380
Everyone?

158
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,590
Well, let me guess. In the end,
it's only you I can trust. Is that it?

159
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,840
Tonight, that's true.

160
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,380
Is it?

161
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,670
Bail organa's team is corrupted.

162
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,550
Which team is that?

163
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,790
The one that's taking you
to yavin after your speech.

164
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,106
I don't know everything, mon,
but I know what I owe you.

165
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,590
You don't care about me.

166
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,396
You're just terrified what'll
happen if I get arrested.

167
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,936
You need to think clearly.

168
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,306
Be careful what you ask for.

169
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,856
You can't leave with bail's people.

170
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,380
And you can't tell anyone
what I've just told you.

171
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,050
Do you remember tay kolma?

172
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,250
The banker? My childhood friend?

173
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,800
Another false savior.

174
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,580
I often think of tay kolma.

175
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,556
How quickly you decided he was a
risk. How quickly all that happened.

176
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,146
If you go with bail's plan,
you'll be in a cell before sunset.

177
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,130
It makes me quite a risk, doesn't it?

178
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,960
Right now, I'm more
afraid of you than anything.

179
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,170
We've all been bent
by secrecy, haven't we?

180
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,356
And I'm sorry about erskin,

181
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,317
but what I'm telling
you about bail is true.

182
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:43,936
Don't you dare!

183
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
What I'm telling you cannot be shared.

184
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,460
I'm sending someone I trust,
someone I know I can trust.

185
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,880
You'll ask if he's alone.

186
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,010
He will say, "I have friends everywhere."

187
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,290
"I have friends everywhere."

188
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,420
Those words.

189
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,356
Supervisor grandi isn't
in yet. I'm still on call.

190
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,646
Is it something that can wait?

191
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,146
Senator mothma, we
have a field agent with her.

192
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,250
Yes, I know. Her driver.

193
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,090
He's been calling in.

194
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,540
Apparently, she's not
left the senate tonight.

195
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,272
Is that unusual?

196
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:31,670
He seems to think so.

197
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,936
We were told to pay particular attention
to the senate for the next few days,

198
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,766
given the situation in ghorman.

199
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,540
Do we have a console?

200
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,476
The technicians said
there's no malfunction

201
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,356
or communication issues on our end.

202
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,306
Right here, these are all senators

203
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,806
the select council have approved

204
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,330
for increased surveillance.

205
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,317
It's always a bit quiet this early,

206
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:57,766
but... that's senator mothma.

207
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,040
It's gone dead.

208
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,960
Plus the driver, it
seemed worth mentioning.

209
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,356
We free to speak?

210
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,880
I've searched everything.

211
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:28,606
I'm not sure I've felt
this... Betrayed in my life,

212
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,550
and I've... Had some experience.

213
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,670
When... did you start?

214
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,340
After the wedding.

215
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,540
Two years.

216
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,160
That's obscene.

217
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,606
I've tried to protect you.

218
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,130
And you've failed.

219
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,620
I'm sorry you feel that way.

220
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,750
You're dismissed.

221
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,800
Immediately.

222
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,500
It's been an honor.

223
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,760
I wasn't sure you'd come.

224
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,670
Wilmon?

225
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,920
There was someone he needed to find.

226
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,806
Excuse me. We have
an immediate problem.

227
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,516
Did you talk to mothma?
What are we doing?

228
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,606
I shouldn't have told her about erskin.

229
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,476
Is she speaking or not?

230
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,790
I don't know.

231
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,550
Somebody knows.

232
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,606
- Where are you?
- I'm walking to the senate.

233
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,050
I'm out. She threw me out.

234
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,936
Is she going through with it?

235
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,540
Ask luthen. We didn't have
much of a conversation.

236
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,580
We get her out, she
goes to yavin and not you?

237
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,960
No yavin for me.

238
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,170
There's still some
Bridges you haven't burned.

239
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,436
We'll take care of that today.

240
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,290
You've stayed here long enough.

241
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,436
I'm not finished yet.

242
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,396
They're gonna find you, luthen!

243
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,250
You act as if we had a choice.

244
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,920
Eventually, they'll hang
us both, won't they?

245
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,630
We set that course the first time we met.

246
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,550
Speak for yourself.

247
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,960
You see no truth in that?

248
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,880
I make my own decisions.

249
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,160
Is that what you've been doing?

250
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,670
Sometimes, I wonder.

251
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,420
You appeared when I needed you.

252
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,340
Aldhani.

253
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,500
Narkina. Ferrix.

254
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,790
Sienar. Mina-rau. Ghorman.

255
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,500
And here we are.

256
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,040
She threw him out.

257
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,856
We don't know if she's speaking,
what she'll say, or how they'll react.

258
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,050
All we know about bail organa's
team is that there's something wrong.

259
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,790
It's hardly ideal.

260
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,646
There's no choice but to try.

261
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,266
We have nothing. He's
never even been inside.

262
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,726
Erskin knows the building.

263
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,266
Putting a lot of faith in erskin.

264
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,936
Mothma knows the building.

265
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,306
And doesn't trust me.
And doesn't know him.

266
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,330
Bail's people might be there already.

267
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,170
And? If she gets arrested?

268
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,910
It all comes down.

269
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,516
Hello?

270
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,686
Identify yourself.

271
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,976
Kloris, sir. Exmar kloris.

272
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,040
Have you located senator mothma?

273
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,806
- No, sir.
- She's been in there all night.

274
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,106
Or she's gone home without you.

275
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,710
Without letting me know?
That's not like her. I doubt it.

276
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,710
She was upset, sir. The
news out of ghorman.

277
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,646
Let us know if anything changes.

278
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,710
Will do. Yes, sir.

279
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,130
Scan docs, please.

280
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,460
Proceed.

281
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,420
Yes, madam. Thank you.

282
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Proceed.

283
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,630
- Ronnie goo...
- "Goo-ja."

284
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,840
Did someone call it in?

285
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,960
Mid-rim network.

286
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,040
I see that. I just don't have
a bay assigned for you.

287
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,186
You'll have to float this morning.

288
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,790
That's the best I can do today.

289
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,000
- You've met?
- Just now.

290
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,856
What are we doing?

291
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,856
Senator mothma's making a speech.

292
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,016
When she's done, we'll
escort her to the Plaza

293
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,306
where there's a ride waiting.

294
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,516
Weapons?

295
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,476
We have a box inside, but the plan
is for a quick and quiet extraction.

296
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,186
Gate 9. She'll meet us there.

297
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,340
We'll pull the gear
and meet you up there.

298
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,210
<i>To make a difference here...
I represent the people...</i>

299
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Well, I'm stuck here now, so

300
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,330
let me know if anything changes.

301
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,226
There are rumors that
prominent senators may try

302
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,146
to challenge the imperial
narrative on ghorman.

303
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,896
I've just been told the
morning agenda is set.

304
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,920
The chair has no intention of
letting any of them take the floor.

305
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,290
Here we are. This day has finally come.

306
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,420
You don't have to do this.

307
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,050
If you're brave enough to stay,
I should be brave enough to go.

308
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,660
There'll be an escort team
waiting. A team of three.

309
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,830
You need to leave the
moment you're done.

310
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,830
They'll be at gate 9.

311
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,130
Get down there. Do what they tell you.

312
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,540
- Do you trust them?
- Of course.

313
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,606
Do you know them?

314
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,670
Personally? No. I can't.

315
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,340
It's not safe.

316
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,146
Don't worry about me.

317
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,710
Once I get you started,
I'll have my head down.

318
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,670
Next year. In yavin.

319
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,120
Take care of yourself, bail.

320
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,920
We do what we can.

321
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,670
Tear the shit out of this place.

322
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,370
<i>The senate is called to chamber.</i>

323
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,160
<i>Make your presence known.</i>

324
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,420
<i>Stewards, you may count the quorum.</i>

325
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,660
You'd think it'd be full today.

326
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,170
They call an early session when
they want to keep the numbers down.

327
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,920
<i>The stewards have declared a quorum...</i>

328
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,380
Have we met?

329
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,010
It's possible.

330
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,590
I have friends everywhere.

331
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,726
Immediately following this session,

332
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,880
we shall submit a list of
our fallen, imperial patriots,

333
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,420
martyrs who gave everything
on the brutal streets of ghorman.

334
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,976
<i>A list that, even now, grows longer</i>

335
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,356
<i>as the full measure of ghorman
perfidy comes into focus.</i>

336
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,146
There's a rope line at the gate.

337
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,920
Take this. It's the only way in,

338
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,146
and I'm the last person she wants to see.

339
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,000
Were we not warned?

340
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,380
<i>Were there not voices raising
the alarm about ghorman long ago?</i>

341
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,186
<i>As the threat grew,</i>

342
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,750
<i>did we not Mark the arrival of
every new ghorman provocation?</i>

343
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:04,380
<i>The tragic broth we sip this morning
has been brewing in plain sight!</i>

344
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,106
<i>The only surprise about
yesterday's insurgency</i>

345
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,800
<i>was the savagery of the ghorman attack!</i>

346
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,750
We, too, lost a citizen
yesterday on the ghorman Plaza.

347
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,686
We, too, are grieving and wondering

348
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,880
what more we might've
done to stop this insurrection.

349
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,670
Watch the door. I'll get the blasters.

350
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,516
And to those who fail to see
this as an emergency, I say,

351
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,606
<i>"what will you tell your people"</i>

352
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,550
"when it is one of your citizens
who've been slaughtered?"

353
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,476
Sir... one of supervisor jung's
agents is calling from the senate.

354
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,646
She says it's urgent.

355
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,130
Line 2.

356
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,620
Hello?

357
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,057
Hello.

358
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:13,040
Identify yourself.

359
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,290
What're you doing?

360
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,830
Who're you talking to?

361
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,630
It was work.

362
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,840
- Show me that.
- Sure.

363
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,870
Hello?

364
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,396
The chair recognizes the
senior senator from hodi.

365
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,460
<i>Graciously accepted, thank you.</i>

366
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,186
<i>I would, as senior senator,
like to yield a moment of my time</i>

367
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,976
to the senior senator of Alderaan

368
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,750
who has a point of order to address.

369
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,790
Thank you, senator erveen.

370
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,646
I need instructions.

371
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,396
I'm putting on the supervisor in charge.

372
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,686
She... she's back on, sir!

373
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,806
I know there's a strict
agenda this morning,

374
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,540
but as per the latest imperial
ruling on senate protocols,

375
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,896
a-17-252, was, as you may recall,

376
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,710
proposed directly by
the emperor's council...

377
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,516
And specifically states that,

378
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,540
"a senior senator, in
the case of emergency"

379
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,266
<i>"may yield the floor freely,"</i>

380
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:31,330
<i>"without interruption to
another senior senator."</i>

381
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,726
<i>Now, senator karloo
spoke so passionately</i>

382
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,830
<i>about the imperial martyrs from
yesterday's events in ghorman.</i>

383
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,380
<i>I listened very
carefully, as did you all...</i>

384
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:50,806
And he clearly, and repeatedly,
used the word "emergency,"

385
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:55,306
<i>and as there's been no objection
to this description from the floor,</i>

386
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,910
I am invoking article 17-252

387
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,500
and yielding the floor to the
senior senator from chandrila.

388
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,936
Shut down the senate feed.

389
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,920
Imperial authority.

390
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,000
Shut it down.

391
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,590
Yes.

392
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,920
Fellow senators, friends, colleagues...

393
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,500
Allies, adversaries.

394
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:00,300
I stand before you this
morning with a heavy heart.

395
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,880
The chandrilan emblem on the door.

396
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,420
I've spent my life in this chamber.

397
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,880
<i>I came here as a child.</i>

398
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,397
- Hey.
- Thank you.

399
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:11,856
And as I look around me now,

400
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,420
<i>I realize I have almost no
memories that pre-date my arrival...</i>

401
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,080
<i>And few bonds of affection
that cleave so tightly.</i>

402
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,670
<i>Through these many years,</i>

403
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,516
<i>I believe I have served
my constituents honorably</i>

404
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,976
<i>and upheld our code of conduct.</i>

405
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,686
- Where were you?
- Where's charval?

406
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,090
He was with you.

407
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,896
- This chamber...
- He said to meet you.

408
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,090
Is a cauldron of opinions...

409
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,556
And we've certainly all had
our Patience and tempers tested

410
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,080
in pursuit of our ideals.

411
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,790
Disagree as we might.

412
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,936
<i>I am hopeful that those of you who
know me will vouch for my credibility</i>

413
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,880
<i>in the days to come.</i>

414
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,330
<i>I stand this morning
with a difficult message.</i>

415
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,356
I believe we are in crisis.

416
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,760
What are they doing?

417
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,686
The distance between
what is said... Shut it down!

418
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:24,420
And what is known to be
true has become an abyss.

419
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,856
It's locked. Why is it locked?

420
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,146
It's supposed to be.

421
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,606
It hasn't been locked all year.

422
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,356
- We know. We fixed it.
- What?

423
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,856
- We checked the protocol...
- open it!

424
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,522
- You need the sequence key.
- So let's have it!

425
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:37,750
We took it up to the
security office yesterday.

426
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,896
Of all the things at risk

427
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:48,380
the loss of an objective reality
is perhaps the most dangerous.

428
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:56,380
<i>The death of truth is
the ultimate victory of evil.</i>

429
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:02,856
When truth leaves us,
when we let it slip away,

430
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,016
when it is ripped from our hands,

431
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:11,356
<i>we become vulnerable to the appetite
of whatever monster screams the loudest.</i>

432
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,146
I don't care if you have to cut
power to the whole chamber!

433
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,567
Get her off the air!

434
00:30:15,591 --> 00:30:19,250
This chamber's hold on the truth

435
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,516
was finally lost on the ghorman Plaza.

436
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:26,620
What took place yesterday...

437
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,186
What happened yesterday on ghorman

438
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,630
was unprovoked genocide!

439
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,896
Yes! Genocide!

440
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,670
And that truth has been
exiled from this chamber!

441
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:47,080
And the monster screaming the loudest?

442
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,840
The monster we've helped create?

443
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,580
The monster who will come
for all of us soon enough...

444
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,210
Is emperor palpatine!

445
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,306
They shut her down. They
shut down the broadcast.

446
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,210
Where's cassian?

447
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,146
He went up.

448
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,210
Look, we can't wait here much longer.

449
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
Senator.

450
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,630
I can't speak right now.

451
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,790
I was in ghorman yesterday.

452
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,500
I saw everything. In the Plaza.

453
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,356
I've made my statement.

454
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,880
No. We need to speak.

455
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,550
I have friends everywhere.

456
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,500
Detained immediately. She
does not leave the building!

457
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,250
Your cousin vel is a friend.

458
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,106
Anyone could say that.

459
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,880
We're the last survivors
of the raid on aldhani.

460
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,766
I see her in yavin.

461
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,170
I live there.

462
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,340
I know luthen can be hard...

463
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,880
But if he's right about this...

464
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,550
You have no choice but to come with me.

465
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,960
You just keep walking.
I'll be right behind you.

466
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,936
Senator mothma!

467
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,016
The senator has no
comment at the moment!

468
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,936
Let her through! Let her through!

469
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,056
Can we get a comment, please?

470
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,226
Move, please! Please!

471
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,186
Excuse us! The senator has a
very important meeting to get to.

472
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,936
- Who are you?
- We're here to help you.

473
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,806
- She doesn't need your help.
- Let's move ahead.

474
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,766
- Stand down, everyone!
- She's got a gun!

475
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,460
- What're you doing?
- Shut up! Back off!

476
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,766
This is an isb authorized arrest!

477
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,210
Call your supervisor now!

478
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,300
Back away! That means you!

479
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,540
- She's a rebel spy!
- No!

480
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,290
Anyone else?

481
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,556
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

482
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,250
We just met, I swear!

483
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,710
- We have no time to figure this out.
- I know.

484
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,686
Go, I'll get there.

485
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,936
We need three minutes.

486
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,250
- I... I'm not isb...
- shut up!

487
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,170
Down!

488
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,977
Are you sure?

489
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:44,420
I've got this, go!

490
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,420
Okay.

491
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,710
Don't run. Don't run!

492
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,250
You killed that woman!

493
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,090
Put this on.

494
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,910
We need to get to the rear loading
dock. There's a ride waiting for us.

495
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,766
I'm not sure I can do this.

496
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,556
Welcome to the rebellion.

497
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,500
- What?
- The loading dock.

498
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,210
She's gone.

499
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,340
They're shutting down the building.

500
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,210
Forget the loading dock.

501
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,817
He's asking to evacuate the building.

502
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:16,976
No! Seal it up! Lock it down!

503
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,056
Where's jung's agent?

504
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,226
We're still trying!

505
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,790
They're at gate 9.
They've killed jung's agent.

506
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,976
- You were told to stand by!
- Right, I am standing by. I was just

507
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,250
<i>- call when you have something to report!
- Yes. Of course. I was just making...</i>

508
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,396
Where are they?

509
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,146
You have to get back to the gallery.

510
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,067
They're coming down
here. You have to warn them.

511
00:35:55,091 --> 00:35:56,266
I'll find them!

512
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,686
Look, I'm trying, but
we've got to be ready.

513
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,856
Go to the gallery.

514
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,396
Secure the area! Cover all the exits!

515
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,840
We're in lockdown! No
one goes out! Move it out!

516
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,670
What's going on up there?

517
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,290
I wish I knew.

518
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,356
That's my driver.

519
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,146
- Would he help?
- No, no, no, he's an isb plant!

520
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,436
- What's his name?
- What?

521
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,646
- Name!
- Kloris.

522
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,396
Kloris! Kloris!

523
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,420
- What are you doing?
- We found her!

524
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,130
And who are you?

525
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,726
Hey. Look at me!

526
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,726
Hey, hey, hey, look at me.

527
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,880
Give me your hand.

528
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,710
Colonel yularen on line 3.

529
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:47,356
All right, everything on the table.

530
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,800
Fall in! Let's go!

531
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,760
Quit your moving about!

532
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,436
Last call on ordnance,

533
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,186
if you've got a weapon
and it's not on that table,

534
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,766
it means you're either
too stupid to follow orders

535
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,330
or you're a threat to base security.

536
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,266
Once the duty officer
has made inspection,

537
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,120
everything that meets
approval will be returned.

538
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,050
Who belongs to this?

539
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,750
I think that's mine.

540
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,460
Are you all right?

541
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,250
I can't believe you made it.

542
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,460
You must be exhausted.

543
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,580
Is he back there?

544
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,290
Made it out. Dreena saved the day.

545
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,120
He needs a real doctor.

546
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,630
Kleya.

547
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,000
Luthen.

548
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,120
He's safe.

549
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,080
He knows you made it back here.

550
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,960
Almost home.

551
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,056
You need to leave right away.

552
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,476
She may need a few
minutes to catch her breath.

553
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,976
She's not going with you.

554
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,080
There's a ship waiting. They
want her to make a speech.

555
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,130
They want her coming
in with a yavin escort.

556
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,210
They wanna rewrite the story.

557
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,500
What does luthen want?

558
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,880
He wants wilmon with a doctor.

559
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,340
Get him ready.

560
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,790
You know this place.

561
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,290
Yeah.

562
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,960
I lived here once.

563
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,630
I'm not sure...

564
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,750
How to thank you.

565
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,760
Make it worth it.

566
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,516
- Let's lift him by the arms.
- Careful.

567
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,976
- Let's go.
- One. Two.

568
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,080
Be careful.

569
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,936
Hey, go with them.

570
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,250
They'll fix him up.

571
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,460
Get some rest. Go.

572
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,606
Is it bad?

573
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,010
No.

574
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:30,186
It's clean. He's young.

575
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,646
Who's his nurse?

576
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,960
She survived the ghorman massacre.

577
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,330
She'll fit right in.

578
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:42,370
We are not gonna log this
in. Any of this. That's the plan.

579
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,040
Gold squadron will
deliver the senator to yavin.

580
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,380
She's making a speech, we
need it broadcast as far as possible.

581
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,830
It's the result that matters.

582
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,130
We can listen in my office if you like.

583
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,130
I've heard her before.

584
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:08,370
There's a dead kx unit bagged up inside.

585
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,266
Kx droid?

586
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:13,420
I think we got all the pieces.

587
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,896
What is it?

588
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,550
Nerian leaf.

589
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:16,896
You need to sleep.

590
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,590
Is that what I need?

591
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:26,880
I'm done, bix.

592
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,760
- Have your tea.
- I'm serious.

593
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:39,620
I'm done. I'm not doing it anymore.

594
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,870
I've done what I can.

595
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:47,760
And I've done a lot, but...

596
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:51,356
But I want... this.

597
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,710
Right here.

598
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,090
I wanna be with you.

599
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,920
I'm gonna talk to Draven tomorrow.

600
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,290
We'll leave before it
gets too complicated.

601
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:19,210
We'll find someplace quiet.

602
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,040
There's still places to go to.

603
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,920
We have what we need.

604
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,460
Why aren't you saying anything?

605
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,000
I'm listening.

606
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:45,960
The only special thing about me is luck...

607
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,130
And I've overplayed my hand already.

608
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,590
Nothing's worth more than this.

609
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,660
- I mean it.
- I know.

610
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:03,120
I know you do.

611
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,880
Bix?

612
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:20,960
My love. You're sleeping now.

613
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,880
You look so peaceful.

614
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:30,710
I wanna be brave, but I can't.

615
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,380
If I was brave, I would
stay and do this in person...

616
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,516
But I know you and
you'd just talk me around,

617
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,710
and I've been thinking about
this too long to let that happen.

618
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,210
I have to leave.

619
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,920
I have to go away.

620
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:52,726
<i>I'm not sure where or for how long,</i>

621
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,540
<i>I just know that I can't
stay here with you now.</i>

622
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,000
<i>I believe what you said.</i>

623
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:03,880
It is a choice.

624
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:07,226
It just can't be me.

625
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,606
<i>I can't be the reason you leave here.</i>

626
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,710
<i>If you ever gave this up for me, I'd.</i>

627
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:15,620
<i>I'd never forgive myself.</i>

628
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,800
We have to win.

629
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,500
We have to beat them.

630
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,710
<i>And I believe you have purpose in
making that happen. I need to believe that.</i>

631
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,420
So, I'm choosing for the both of us.

632
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,410
I'm choosing the rebellion.

633
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,590
Hey! You can't stand there!

634
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,880
We're waiting on a freighter,
we gotta keep this clear.

635
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,396
The outbound. The
transport, where are they?

636
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,000
Everything that's
leaving went this morning.

637
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:23,516
- And when it's done...
- When it's over...

638
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,170
And we've won...

639
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,130
We can do all the things we ever wanted.

640
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,410
Everything we'd know we've missed.

641
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,670
I'll find you.

642
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,420
- Captain and or?
- They were looking for you.

643
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,290
They're getting ready to power
up the droid you brought in.

644
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,790
The kx unit?

645
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,330
So...

646
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,380
It either works or... it doesn't.

647
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:37,812
We can tweak endlessly once it's stable.

648
00:51:37,836 --> 00:51:41,290
It's really just a question of whether
the cortex-swap is rejected or not.

649
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:46,436
You'll hear a lot of blather
about "re-programming,"

650
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,790
which makes it sound as though it's a
problem solved behind a console, but...

651
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,686
That's nonsense, frankly.

652
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,936
It's really all about
"impulse suppression,"

653
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:59,630
which is an entirely...
Engineering and wiring issue.

654
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:06,960
Right. We have some
protective goggles here.

655
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,000
I'll take a weapon.

656
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,580
You may wish to take a step back.

657
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,936
Turn it on.

658
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,766
It's just... I'm not sure that's safe.

659
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:28,976
Hit the switch.

660
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,170
Very well.

661
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:33,090
If that makes us ready.

662
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:37,460
Three.

663
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,170
Two.

664
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,250
One.

665
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,580
Hello.

666
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,420
If I've offended you, I apologize.

667
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:21,580
If not, I'd appreciate you
pointing that elsewhere.
