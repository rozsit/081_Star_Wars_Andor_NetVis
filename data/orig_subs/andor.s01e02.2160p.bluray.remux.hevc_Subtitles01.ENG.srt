1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:08,049
No weapons. No comms.
No credit. No nonsense.

2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,564
A friend of mine said there

3
00:00:09,588 --> 00:00:11,219
was a girl from Kenari working here.

4
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,721
I'm looking for my sister.

5
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,264
People come and go.

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,390
You should leave.

7
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,018
Wh... What was her name?

8
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,520
Nobody here gives their real name.

9
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,479
Excuse me. We were here first.

10
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:26,026
Oh, that is a hard look
for a little thing like you.

11
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,235
Stop right there!

12
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,071
He's not breathing.

13
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,322
You killed him.

14
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:34,425
You've been very busy.

15
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,744
Two men are dead, sir.

16
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,828
Employees.

17
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:40,081
If that's not worth staying up for,
then I'm not worthy of the uniform.

18
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,834
I know one of these men.
He was a squad commander on Four.

19
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,086
One of the most unpleasant people
I've ever met.

20
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,798
- But they were murdered.
- No. They were killed in a fight.

21
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,801
They clearly harassed
a human with dark features

22
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,969
and chose the wrong person to annoy.

23
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,681
- I have something to sell.
- What?

24
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,266
I got an untraceable NS-9 Starpath unit.

25
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,810
Your friend will want this piece.

26
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:01,477
What is that?

27
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:05,190
Find it. Whatever it is, I want to know
when it left and where it went.

28
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,316
Let's go!

29
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,109
Kassa!

30
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:34,941
Shut the door.

31
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,822
Scram! Get out of it!

32
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:36,795
Everythin' okay?

33
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,381
Just tired.

34
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,093
Too tired for a meal?

35
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,386
Was that the plan?

36
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,305
Could be.

37
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,601
I thought we said one night a week.

38
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,519
Let's, uh, start the week tonight.

39
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,479
Let's do this.

40
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:58,650
Why don't we do something fun
tomorrow night?

41
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,026
There's a plan.

42
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,820
Just lock up the back.

43
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,822
I'll take care of all this.

44
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,365
- Thank you.
- Yep.

45
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,235
Don't you say a word.

46
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,987
I mean it.

47
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,824
There you are.

48
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,077
Don't you look comfortable.

49
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,539
Hey.

50
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,916
Hey, Bee.

51
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:00,671
Everything okay?

52
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,132
Oh. Oh, this?

53
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,301
Oh, I need a wash. Uh...

54
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,429
I was helping Pegla
and tripped on a cable.

55
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,516
- You've been busy.
- Yeah.

56
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,475
I ran into Brasso last night.

57
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,021
We had a lot to talk about.

58
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,439
Mmm, sounds fascinating.

59
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,858
I would have come home this morning,

60
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,235
but everything I had going on
was over East.

61
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,822
I've been trying to get back all day.

62
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,490
I'm gonna go get cleaned up.

63
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:30,826
Read it to him, Bee.

64
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:32,994
Read what?

65
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,996
I c-c-can speak now?

66
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,164
Read it.

67
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,085
"P-P-Pre-Mor Authority
is seeking a Kenari male resident"

68
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,670
"of Ferrix for questioning."

69
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,880
"Citizens with any information
should contact"

70
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,342
"the Preox-Morlana Security HQ
without d-d-delay."

71
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:51,972
Who else knows?

72
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,724
About what?

73
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,225
That you were born in Kenari.

74
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,893
You don't want to hear what happened?

75
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,521
Mmm-hmm, we'll get to that. But
who knows? Who have we told?

76
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,606
I don't know. I...

77
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,065
We have always said Fest.

78
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,026
Every doc I've ever submitted
has always said you were born on Fest.

79
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,695
Have you ever said anything
other than Fest?

80
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,030
Officially, no.
I don't think so. But people, yes.

81
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,156
- Who?
- Uh... And so did you.

82
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,908
- Well, how many?
- I don't know.

83
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,785
It's not something
I've been keeping track of!

84
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,954
Well, everyone I've told is dead.

85
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,372
That's ridiculous.

86
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,750
- Jezzi. Sammo. Hmm?
- That's family.

87
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,502
If we're making a list,
we're making a list.

88
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,545
Well, it's all your women
that I'm worried about.

89
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,172
- Oh, come on. Please. Stop. Stop!
- Femmi, Karla, Sondreen.

90
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:27,584
There are some names I don't even know!

91
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:28,640
B-B-Bix.

92
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:29,968
Bix has nothing to do with this!

93
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,263
But then who told these
Pre-Mor bastards about Kenari?

94
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,267
That would be me.

95
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,437
Bix. B-B-Bix is l-l-looking for you.

96
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,314
- What?
- Well, why would you do that?

97
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:45,560
When? When? When did she call? Just now?

98
00:08:45,585 --> 00:08:46,589
What? Tell me.

99
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:48,529
- C-C-Comm fail. Your comms.
- Bee, where is she?

100
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:49,946
- How did that come up?
- Come on.

101
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,615
- Just forget that.
- Is she still in the yard?

102
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,992
- What do they want?
- Bee? Wait!

103
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,745
Bee, where is she?

104
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,290
C-c-comms access throttle.
C-c-calculating reroute.

105
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,584
Cassian.

106
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,378
What have you done?

107
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:10,884
I messed up.

108
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,950
Haven't been here in a while.

109
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,702
I wasn't sure what was safe.

110
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,078
You saw the notice.

111
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,329
What did you do?

112
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,291
Two guys jumped me. It went too far.

113
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,251
How far is too far?

114
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,504
They were shaking me down.

115
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,048
I wasn't looking for a fight.

116
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,384
Listen, forget what I said this morning.

117
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,845
I'll sell you the piece.

118
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,847
I just need enough to get out of here.

119
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,099
He's coming.

120
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,101
The buyer's coming.

121
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,312
It's too late to call him off.
He'll be here in the morning.

122
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,442
Hey.

123
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,486
I won't forget this.

124
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,876
You should go.

125
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,127
Yeah. Okay.

126
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,804
You called him, right?

127
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,681
He's on his way up.

128
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:25,101
Cassian Andor. This says he's from Fest.

129
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,938
This was a tip call, right?
Probably someone messing with us.

130
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,316
- I don't see Kenari here.
- Hold on. I have an image.

131
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,238
"Insurrection,
destruction of Imperial property,"

132
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,865
"assault on Imperial soldier."

133
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,618
Check the database.
See if it says anything about Kenari.

134
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:42,744
We have a suspect?

135
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,830
Not sure yet. We're
about to get an image.

136
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,787
Who is it?

137
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,247
Is it too late?

138
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,049
Your light was on.

139
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,635
I'm here.

140
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,344
Yeah, I... I see that.

141
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,348
Uh, no, I meant...
I meant, yes, it's not too late.

142
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,433
I couldn't sleep.

143
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:54,650
- But if it's not a good time, then...
- No. No. Not at all.

144
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,699
I'm just... I'm surprised.

145
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,577
Good.

146
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,289
Do you want something to drink or...

147
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,957
No. I've had enough.

148
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,172
You all right?

149
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:19,758
I am now.

150
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,593
Sergeant Linus Mosk
at your service, sir.

151
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,344
Sorry to roust you
in the middle of the night.

152
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,347
No, sir. Privilege, sir.
Got the brief on the ride in.

153
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,849
I'd like to move on this quickly.

154
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:12,143
We have a dangerous, mobile suspect
in a very serious crime.

155
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,478
Couldn't agree more, sir.

156
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:14,771
Tempo is crucial.

157
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,190
Velocity in the service
of inspired leadership,

158
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,817
is there a worthy substitute?

159
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,068
I think not.

160
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,196
It's one suspect.
How many men do you think we'd need?

161
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,240
I'd say 12, sir, just to be prudent.

162
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,450
Will you be suiting up with us, sir?

163
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,787
- I think I should. Don't you?
- Absolutely, sir.

164
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,914
Show of force. Boost morale.

165
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,709
Nothin' like seein'
an officer on the line.

166
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,418
- Excellent.
- If I may, sir,

167
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,546
hats off to you and Chief Inspector.

168
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,423
Two men dead, line of duty, colleagues?

169
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:43,842
- It's outrageous.
- Exactly!

170
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,634
The thought of anything less than

171
00:14:45,658 --> 00:14:47,220
full engagement on a case like this...

172
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:48,496
Unconscionable, sir.

173
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,474
- Dereliction of duty, at the minimum.
- It would be, wouldn't it?

174
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,976
I've seen it, sir.

175
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,185
Half measures.

176
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,022
The take-it-slow, the wait-and-see.

177
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,940
It's a plague on discipline.

178
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,151
Face your men, yourself,
the rest of your life,

179
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,820
knowing you did less
than everything you possibly could?

180
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,072
I've been saying all along
we need a stronger hand

181
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,949
with these affiliated planets.

182
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,702
There's fomenting out there, sir.

183
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,329
Pockets of fomenting.

184
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:17,375
Corporate Tactical Forces
are the Empire's first line of defense,

185
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,962
and the best way to keep
the blade sharp is to use it.

186
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,715
So, well,

187
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,510
thank you, sir.

188
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,305
I'll pass along your kind words
to the Chief Inspector.

189
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,183
Sir!

190
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:31,987
Psst. Kassa.

191
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,336
Optimize landing.

192
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,338
Landing scanned and locked.

193
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,549
How long a walk this time?

194
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,218
The shuttle will be 2.3 klicks away.

195
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:56,928
There's nothing closer?

196
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,139
Nothing safe.

197
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,344
Hey.

198
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,889
What are you doing?

199
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,225
Ah, couldn't sleep.

200
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,066
Tell me you have caf.

201
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,151
Was just about to put it on.

202
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:40,448
Can you open up the yard
for me this morning?

203
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,117
Uh, sure.

204
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:53,754
You okay?

205
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,841
Yeah. Yeah. Just, um... Just tired.

206
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,094
What's up this mornin'?

207
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,930
Just got a few errands to run.

208
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,057
Won't be long.

209
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:15,150
I'm sure I had some comms in here.

210
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,279
It's crap.

211
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,031
Why do we n-n-need comms?

212
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:23,366
Here we go.

213
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,662
You could just come and t-tell me.

214
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,541
You haven't been listening to me,
have you?

215
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,376
You have to go away.

216
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,460
And?

217
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:36,129
You have c-c-credits for Maarva.

218
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,299
You need to t-t-tell me
where you're hiding them.

219
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:43,094
Because we don't want someone else
to find Maarva's credits, do we?

220
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:44,387
I agree.

221
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,557
You should stay.

222
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,892
If I can bring them myself, I will.

223
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,520
But if I can't, we need
the comms, right?

224
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,689
Bee...

225
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,066
Going is a b-b-bad idea.

226
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,736
You need to get back.
She's gonna wonder where you are.

227
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,821
Come on.

228
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:02,614
Go!

229
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,585
Bee?

230
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,462
Bee?

231
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,257
Bee?

232
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:26,847
If you've powered down back here again,
I'll be so upset with you.

233
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:30,475
Hmm.

234
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:52,914
Mmm.

235
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,591
You're wrong.

236
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:52,427
It's the confidence that's irritating.

237
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:55,055
I am looking it up!

238
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,265
Hey. Haven't seen you in a while.

239
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:00,977
- You got a minute?
- I'm just... I'm looking up Kenari.

240
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:03,146
What's that?

241
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,440
Yeah. He never heard of it either.

242
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,570
"Kenari. Mid Rim."

243
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:12,906
"Abandoned after
Imperial mining disaster."

244
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,491
Mining. Everyone died.

245
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:19,454
"Abandoned and considered toxic.
Imperial prohibition."

246
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,124
No, no, there's no reward.

247
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,168
Corporate enforcement
are looking for someone.

248
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,920
You know anybody from Kenari?

249
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:30,173
What can I do for you?

250
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,842
How much for a run to Tassar?

251
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,094
- When?
- Today.

252
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:35,804
What would we be picking up?

253
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:37,598
Give me the price for not knowing.

254
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:40,601
- Weight?
- Not important.

255
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:41,977
- Explosive?
- No, no.

256
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,437
- Does it talk?
- Give me a number, Xan.

257
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:46,231
Nine hundred.

258
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:48,775
A real number.

259
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:51,027
You want immediacy and discretion.

260
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,529
That's an expensive combo.

261
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:55,031
- I got 500.
- Well, you should plan more carefully.

262
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,701
- Okay, let's split the difference.
- It's your choice.

263
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:00,370
You want to go today
and have me keep my mouth shut?

264
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:01,747
Seven's my floor.

265
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,418
Okay, if it's seven,
you better be ready in an hour.

266
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,379
Keep the engine running.

267
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:14,300
Will you let it go?

268
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,730
All right, gentlemen.

269
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,649
Cassian Andor.

270
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,776
Not a recent image,
but the best we've got.

271
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,821
He may not appear to be
a formidable opponent,

272
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:37,741
but two of our men are dead
having made that mistake.

273
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,453
West Team will include
Deputy Inspector Karn and myself.

274
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:45,582
We will endeavor to serve
the warrant and exfil rapidly.

275
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:48,209
North and East Team
will take positions accordingly

276
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:51,462
for a pincer movement
should the subject attempt to flee.

277
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,509
Andor should be considered
armed and dangerous.

278
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,636
We will have the element of surprise,

279
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:01,097
but there should be no illusions
as to the risks involved.

280
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,266
There may be some local residents

281
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,728
who are less than enthused
with our presence.

282
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:10,023
You may remind them
that there's a Territorial Forum

283
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,358
once a month where they are free
to make official complaints.

284
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:17,280
All yours, sir.

285
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,338
Thank you for being here.

286
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,720
There comes a time when the...

287
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:45,475
the risk of doing nothing
becomes the greatest risk of all.

288
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:50,856
This is one of those decisive moments,

289
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:55,664
and I can't imagine a team I'd

290
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:58,669
rather share it with than all of you.

291
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:05,203
There's no room for doubt
on the path to...

292
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,915
success...

293
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,961
and, uh, justice.

294
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,009
Best of luck to us all.

295
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,442
All right, then. Carry on.

296
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:40,071
Well said, sir.

297
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:43,241
Inspiring.

298
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:01,927
You believe this?

299
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,805
Incredible, right?

300
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:06,389
We're circling.

301
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,808
We're stacked up.

302
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:10,393
Crazy, right?

303
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,022
We should be charging them.

304
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:17,609
What'd they stick you to park your ship?

305
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,195
Sixty credits.

306
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:22,280
Gutty, aren't they?

307
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:25,158
Chargin' us to come and spend our money.

308
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,161
They get you comin' and goin'.

309
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:31,414
I'm old enough,

310
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,710
I first came here,
you could drive in across the wasteland.

311
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:36,878
They had a groundcarry.

312
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:38,088
Drive right through.

313
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,091
That was no bargain either.

314
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,802
You'd make the round trip
and taste it a week later.

315
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:47,347
Just nasty.

316
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,433
Now it's this.

317
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,520
What's your line?

318
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:56,648
Rather not say?

319
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:58,859
No need to explain.

320
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:02,028
Who knows
who you're talking to these days.

321
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:04,280
Me, I'm in propulsion.

322
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:06,950
We do add-ons and boosters.

323
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:13,582
Mmm.

324
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,376
Never changes, does it?

325
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:19,838
You know what they say?

326
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:22,257
No, what's that?

327
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:25,426
If you can't find it here,
it's not worth finding.
