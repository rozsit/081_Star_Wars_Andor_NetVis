1
00:00:01,583 --> 00:00:05,166
When was the last time
you spoke with Cassian Andor?

2
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,500
<i>Ferrix has been
hiding long enough.</i>

3
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,458
<i>So now
you're taking on the Empire?</i>

4
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,291
What's left to keep you here?

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:16,375
The Rebellion.

6
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:19,166
Did he tell you?
He's writin' a manifesto.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,875
You're my ideal reader.

8
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,875
He said to give this to you.

9
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:32,375
So, searching for a more
fluid banking situation, are we?

10
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,708
What will it cost?

11
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,375
I have a 14-year-old son.
I'd like to bring him with me.

12
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,541
- I'm not asking for betrothal.
- Then what are we talking about?

13
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:40,625
<i>An introduction.</i>

14
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,000
<i>Your daughter's 13.
She'll soon come of age.</i>

15
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,833
Don't tell me you're taking proposals.

16
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm in so much trouble, Vel.

17
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,875
ISB knows Kreegyr's plan.
They'll be waiting for him.

18
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:54,125
- You think it's worth losing Kreegyr?
- I did.

19
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,434
<i>Calling about Andor.</i>

20
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,833
<i>You wanted news if I had it.</i>

21
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,041
Yes. Please, go on.

22
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,583
<i>The mother.
She's passed away.</i>

23
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,458
<i>He might show up at the funeral.</i>

24
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,559
<i>- They just moved the body.</i>
- What happens now?

25
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:08,000
<i>As a prominent citizen of Ferrix,
she rates a big send-off.</i>

26
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,666
They'll want to close Rix Road.

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,375
You're going to give them a permit.

28
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:12,458
<i>Cass, I'm sorry.</i>

29
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:14,708
<i>Your mother's dead.</i>

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're here.

31
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,333
Welcome. And just in time for dinner.

32
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,666
I'll eat later.

33
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,375
I want to get changed,
take a walk around the town.

34
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,500
I'll pull an escort.

35
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,583
No need.

36
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,125
Corv will take me.

37
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,541
Keep it small.

38
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,750
As you wish.

39
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,625
- Xan.
- Hey.

40
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,041
Looked like you were wrapping up,
so I thought I'd wait.

41
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,166
- How long you been here?
- I spoke to Cassian.

42
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,291
- What?
- He called the shop.

43
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,375
How?

44
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,833
Picked up the old box line
and there he was.

45
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,226
- Where?
- I don't know. I...

46
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,625
- Where is he?
- He wouldn't say.

47
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,416
Does he know about Maarva?

48
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,541
Yeah, he does now.

49
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,166
It was a very short conversation.

50
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,458
- He asked about the funeral.
- Let's walk.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,958
- Who else knows this?
- No one.

52
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,250
Keep it that way.

53
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,583
Can't be too careful.

54
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,875
They're watching Maarva's.
Could be anywhere.

55
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,833
He'd be insane to come back now.

56
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,416
I hope you told him that.

57
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,583
Like I said, it was a very short call.

58
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:50,000
I can't stop thinkin' about
this whole Maarva situation.

59
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,291
Imagine losing you mother like this.

60
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,708
I couldn't stand it.

61
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,250
Not being there for your mom.

62
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:03,916
Have Brasso place her stone,
just breaks your heart, right?

63
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,291
You gotta feel for Cassian.

64
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,583
I'd be losing my mind.

65
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,416
Want another?

66
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,333
Maybe just one.

67
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,017
Why worry it though?

68
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,666
It's not like he knows about it.

69
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,333
Guarantee you,
he's got no idea what's going on.

70
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,583
Bank on that.

71
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,416
I wouldn't be so sure.

72
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:30,875
Hey.

73
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,083
You know something I don't?

74
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,708
Do me a favor, keep it that way.

75
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,708
Hey.

76
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,000
We'll have another round.

77
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,041
I thought you left without me.

78
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,458
- Crossed my mind.
- Mmm.

79
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,083
- I looked for you but, uh...
- I'm sure.

80
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,250
Kloris, we'd like privacy, please.

81
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,375
Ma'am.

82
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,208
What now?

83
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,666
You're gambling again.

84
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,416
- Nonsense.
- And here, in Coruscant.

85
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,791
That's ridiculous.

86
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,208
Do you have any idea
how tired of this I am?

87
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,976
<i>It's a lie.</i>

88
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,680
<i>It's total fantasy.
Who's telling you this?</i>

89
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,333
- Please.
- No, I'm serious.

90
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,416
Perrin, please.

91
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,250
- Who is saying this?
- Just don't.

92
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,250
We'll go back there, right now.
We'll put it to an end.

93
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,375
We will not.
I've been shamed enough for one night.

94
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,375
You can't live without a casino? Fine.

95
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:53,958
You go to Canto Bight
and do whatever it is you need to do.

96
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,583
But not here.

97
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,708
You promised.

98
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,250
- I've kept my promise!
- Keep your voice down.

99
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,125
<i>He can't hear me.</i>

100
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,541
<i>This is wrong, Mon.</i>

101
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,583
<i>This is people trying to take you down
by coming after me.</i>

102
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,581
You tell me who's saying this
and I'll tell you why.

103
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,083
Oh, please.

104
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,333
Where would I get the money?

105
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,083
That's the question
that scares me the most.

106
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,541
Someone's lying to you.

107
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,166
On that, we can agree.

108
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:46,916
You're here.

109
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,708
I couldn't remember
if I'd locked the door,

110
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,500
if you'd even remember how to get here.

111
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,809
- And here I am.
- I was on my way to pick you up.

112
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,791
This guy I've been watching, he's ISB.

113
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,458
He's their guy in town.

114
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,125
His boss showed up tonight.

115
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,333
Good to see you too.

116
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:12,000
An ISB supervisor came in tonight.

117
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,083
A woman.

118
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,125
Here. Now.

119
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,500
I was on my way to pick you up

120
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,583
when they left the hotel
dressed like locals.

121
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,250
I had to follow.

122
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,833
They're getting ready, Vel.

123
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,333
They must know Andor's coming.

124
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,916
You did the right thing.

125
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,375
We have to get there first.

126
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,958
- I know.
- Everything depends on it.

127
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,250
I said I know.

128
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,208
Come away from the window.

129
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,333
<i>Here's the thing, Cassian.</i>

130
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,458
<i>The man who sees everything
is more blessed than cursed.</i>

131
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,583
<i>Look at that. Here we go.</i>

132
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,125
Stand back, let it drip.

133
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,500
Look how quickly that's cleaned up.

134
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,583
Hard to believe, right?

135
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,333
Two minutes.

136
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,625
No longer, no shorter.

137
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,583
You know why
they don't make these anymore?

138
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,642
'Cause they'd rather sell you
a brand new system at ten times the price.

139
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,125
I mean, how many we got?

140
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,666
60? 70 of them?

141
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,333
Just sittin' there.

142
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,375
Five hundred credits each.

143
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,958
People don't look down
to where they should.

144
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,541
They don't look down,
they don't look past the rust.

145
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,791
<i>Not us though, eh?</i>

146
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,166
<i>Eyes open, possibilities everywhere.</i>

147
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,625
Just need to get this cleaned up

148
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,958
before Maarva find us
doing this in the house.

149
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,208
Who's there?

150
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,333
- Cass?
- Pegla?

151
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,583
Down, now!

152
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,250
Huh.

153
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,916
I don't believe it.

154
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Hey.

155
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,625
I'm just...

156
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,458
I'm so sorry.

157
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,208
I loved your mom, I really did.

158
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,541
I know.

159
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,625
It's good to see ya.

160
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,416
What are you doing here?

161
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,666
Just keepin' an eye
on the place till we sell it.

162
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,750
Sell it?

163
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,958
Where's Bix?

164
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,500
Where is she?

165
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,291
Cass...

166
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,458
Where is she?

167
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,375
<i>"There will be times
when the struggle seems impossible.</i>

168
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,541
<i>"I know this already.</i>

169
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,916
<i>"Alone, unsure,</i>

170
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,416
<i>"dwarfed by the scale of the enemy.</i>

171
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,000
<i>"Remember this.
Freedom is a pure idea.</i>

172
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,125
<i>"It occurs spontaneously

173
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:59,416
<i>"Random acts of insurrection are occurring
constantly throughout the galaxy.</i>

174
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,500
<i>"There are whole armies,
battalions that have no idea</i>

175
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,750
<i>"that they've already
enlisted in the cause.</i>

176
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:09,333
<i>"Remember that the frontier
of the Rebellion is everywhere.</i>

177
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:13,083
<i>"And even the smallest act of insurrection
pushes our lines forward.</i>

178

<i>"And then remember this.</i>

179
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,750
<i>"The Imperial need
for control is so desperate</i>

180
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,250
<i>"because it is so unnatural.</i>

181
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,041
<i>"Tyranny requires constant effort.</i>

182
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,541
<i>"It breaks, it leaks.</i>

183
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,000
<i>"Authority is brittle.</i>

184
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,833
<i>"Oppression is the mask of fear.</i>

185
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,458
<i>"Remember that.</i>

186
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,625
<i>"And know this,</i>

187
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,083
<i>"the day will come
when all these skirmishes and battles,</i>

188
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,833
<i>"these moments of defiance</i>

189
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,934
<i>"will have flooded the banks
of the Empire's authority</i>

190
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,458
<i>"and then there will be one too many.</i>

191
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,666
<i>"One single thing will break the siege.</i>

192
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,791
<i>"Remember this.</i>

193
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,166
<i>"Try."</i>

194
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,958
We've loosened air traffic
as you requested.

195
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,125
Pulled back our uniform patrols,
relaxed our curfew.

196
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,666
We've baited the trap and opened the door.

197
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,708
We've got recon units
prepped and positioned.

198
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,833
I know you've got
your own sources out there.

199
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,041
What time is the funeral?

200
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,250
They asked for midday.

201
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,708
We pushed it back two hours.

202
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,791
They slow down a bit after lunch.

203
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,250
And the funeral area?

204
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,166
Right there. That's her box.

205
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,791
We're allowing them
half of Rix Road for one block.

206
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,875
We gave them a max of 30 people.

207
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,666
The Daughters pushed back,
so we've upped it to 40.

208
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,000
"Daughters"?

209
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,416
The Daughters of Ferrix.

210
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,625
It's a social club.

211
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,375
Andor's mother was a past president.

212
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,125
A local annoyance.

213
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,666
The control position's here,
here, and here.

214
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,208
We'll have snipers
and a containment unit there.

215
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,750
Containment, yes. Snipers, no.

216
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,375
I want him taken alive.

217
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,583
I want that message passed along the line.

218
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,958
And clearly.

219
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,583
"Where would I get the money?"

220
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,375
"That's what scares me the most."

221
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,583
That's right. Word for word.

222
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,750
Was she more angry about him lying
or the possibility of gambling debts?

223
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,208
Hard to say.

224
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,083
Mon Mothma is of great interest here.

225
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:41,666
Having her husband dig a hole
for himself could be helpful in many ways.

226
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,208
Well, it sounded like
Perrin had done this before.

227
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,125
They've made some
odd banking moves recently.

228
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,833
This would certainly explain it.

229
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,166
Kreegyr. You're missing it.

230
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,333
Keep listening.

231
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,333
You can close out your Anto Kreegyr files.

232
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,541
How many attacked?

233
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,291
They're still counting the bodies.

234
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's over?

235
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,208
They walked right into it.

236
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,750
It was over before they started.

237
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,833
Prisoners?

238
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,333
Not today.

239
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,041
Take a guess who's not happy about that.

240
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:24,833
She called in.

241
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,125
He's been talking her down.

242
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,333
<i>I just wish
I had been part of the conversation, sir.</i>

243
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,291
This wasn't a dialogue, Dedra.

244
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,541
We get nothing from a dead body.

245
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,041
Someone needs to be
in the room saying that.

246
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,791
<i>You're missing the point.</i>

247
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,666
Today was about wiping the taste
of Aldhani from the Emperor's mouth.

248
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,458
You want to start a conversation?

249
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,625
Find Axis.

250
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,250
That's not him.

251
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,166
<i>- Sir?</i>
- The big man.

252
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,291
We've been played.

253
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:52,916
Where is he?

254
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,166
Okay.

255
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,333
Make it quick.

256
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,250
I wanted her to leave with me.

257
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,041
- I know.
- I came to get her.

258
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,125
She told me.

259
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,500
I couldn't get back.

260
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,500
You shouldn't be here now, Cass.

261
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,708
- But the last time I saw her, we argued.
- Don't.

262
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,750
- I told her I was coming back.
- Stop.

263
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,208
- I never should have left that morning.
- Stop.

264
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,500
She told me you'd say all this.

265
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,958
"Tell him, none of this is his fault.

266
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,125
"It was already burning.
He's just the first spark of the fire.

267
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,166
"Tell him,
he knows everything he needs to know

268
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,208
"and feels everything he needs to feel.

269
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,125
"And when the day comes,
and those two pull together,

270
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,875
"he will be
an unstoppable force for good.

271
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:16,916
"Tell him...

272
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,041
"I love him more than anything
he could ever do wrong."

273
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,750
- Hey.
- Who's that?

274
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,208
There's different shifts
that they're taking.

275
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,958
Street's clear. Hurry up.

276
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,250
- Bix?
- Still got friends in the hotel.

277
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,958
- She was alive three days ago.
- Why are they keeping her?

278
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,833
She must know something.

279
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,000
We can't just leave her there.

280
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,291
You're gonna take on a full garrison?

281
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,208
I'll take care of Maarva.

282
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,791
You take care of yourself.

283
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,375
It's too late for that.

284
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,041
Any luck?

285
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,458
Was getting worried.

286
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,125
What's the verdict?
Has he come home or not?

287
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,250
They seem to think so.
They're everywhere.

288
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:40,291
- There's an ISB supervisor in town.
- A woman?

289
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:42,541
You know her?

290
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,166
Not yet.

291
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,208
This is good.

292
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,916
How is this possibly good?

293
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,541
They'll do the hunting for us.

294
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,250
They'll want him alive.

295
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,958
They'll find him, we'll kill him.

296
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,375
Where will they take him?

297
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,583
The hotel.

298
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,791
So that's our target.

299
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,750
We just need him dead
before they start asking questions.

300
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,833
How long do we have
before the festivities start?

301
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,791
Few hours. You'll hear the anvil.

302
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,375
- Where's Cinta?
- Watching the mother's house.

303
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,378
Oh, forget that.
Get her up to the hotel.

304
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,708
I'll have a look around.

305
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,333
What's going on?

306
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,666
Get Cinta. I'll be at the hotel.

307
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:14,916
What's going on?

308
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:16,833
I'm not sure.

309
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:46,934
<i>I can hear music, sir.</i>

310
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:08,833
<i>Of course I hear it.</i>

311
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,625
I'm just not seeing it.

312
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:14,958
They've started.
They're coming from all over town.

313
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,708
I want everything out here.

314
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,333
Show of force immediately.

315
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,291
Stand to!

316
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,833
Double time, form up.

317
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:28,041
Let's move!

318
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,208
You call this a perimeter?

319
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:55,541
Square this away!

320
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:58,750
Get these people off the streets.

321
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,125
Team one here.

322
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,000
- Team two here.
- Go, go, go!

323
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,291
Team three...

324
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,291
Restrict them!

325
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,041
Move! Move! Move!

326
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,250
Go, go, go!

327
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,291
Move! Move! Move!

328
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,625
Take a unit down there.

329
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,541
You, Captain, take them that way.

330
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:44,375
- Double the reward.
- You found him?

331
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:47,041
I want twice as much
and a ride out of here when it's over.

332
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,000
- Where is he?
- Pretend you're arresting me.

333
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,643
- Hey!
- What do you think you're doing?

334
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,208
Hey. Move it. Move!

335
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:06,291
Right,
we need to assume the positions.

336
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:07,583
Secure the perimeter.

337
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,291
Back!

338
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,625
- Which building?
- Across the street.

339
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:43,101
- I need two men.
- He's seen him?

340
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,184
- No, but he's sure he's there.
- We're wasting time.

341
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,184
I've got a recon unit
on the terrace up there now...

342
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,583
No. I need him alive.

343
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,666
Don't make me say it again.

344
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,125
Sir.

345
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,208
She's here.

346
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,541
It's her.

347
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:01,166
- What are we doing?
- We're wasting time.

348
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:43,000
Stone and sky. Stone and sky.

349
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:46,291
Stone and sky. Stone and sky...

350
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,833
Stone and sky.

351
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,208
- Tenek.
- Cassian.

352
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,333
Where's Bix?

353
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,416
I'm sorry about your mother.

354
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,291
<i>My name is Maarva Carassi Andor.</i>

355
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,791
<i>I'm honored to stand before you.</i>

356
00:32:50,875 --> 00:32:53,125
<i>I'm honored
to be a Daughter of Ferrix,</i>

357
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,291
<i>and honored to be worthy of the stone.</i>

358
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,125
<i>Strange, I...</i>

359
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,000
<i>feel as if I can see it.</i>

360
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:13,583
<i>I was six, I think,
first time I touched a funerary stone.</i>

361
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:19,208
<i>Heard our music, felt our history.</i>

362
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:24,666
<i>Holding my sister's hand as we walked
all the way from Fountain Square.</i>

363
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:30,500
<i>Where you stand now,
I've been more times than I can remember.</i>

364
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:34,416
<i>I always wanted to be lifted.</i>

365
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,208
<i>I was always eager,
always waiting to be inspired.</i>

366
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:46,375
<i>I remember every time it happened,
every time the dead lifted me...</i>

367
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:52,500
<i>With their truth.</i>

368
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,666
<i>And now I'm dead.</i>

369
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,958
<i>And I yearn to lift you.</i>

370
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,541
<i>Not because I want to shine
or even be remembered.</i>

371
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,625
<i>It's because I want you to go on.</i>

372
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:17,000
<i>I want Ferrix to continue.</i>

373
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:21,750
<i>In my waning hours,
that's what comforts me most.</i>

374
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:24,083
<i>But I fear for you.</i>

375
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:27,500
<i>We've been sleeping.</i>

376
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,166
<i>We've had each other,
and Ferrix, our work, our days.</i>

377
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,375
<i>We had each other, and they left us alone.</i>

378
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:40,208
<i>We kept the trade lanes open,
and they left us alone.</i>

379
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:43,833
<i>We took their money and ignored them,</i>

380
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,250
<i>we kept their engines churning,</i>

381
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,958
<i>and the moment they pulled away,
we forgot them.</i>

382
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:52,625
<i>Because we had each other.</i>

383
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:56,625
<i>We had Ferrix.</i>

384
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,875
<i>But we were sleeping.</i>

385
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:04,416
<i>I've been sleeping.</i>

386
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:09,583
<i>And I've been turning away from the truth
I wanted not to face.</i>

387
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:15,541
<i>There is a wound that won't heal
at the center of the galaxy.</i>

388
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:22,750
<i>There is a darkness reaching like rust
into everything around us.</i>

389
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,625
<i>We let it grow, and now it's here.</i>

390
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:30,666
<i>It's here, and it's not visiting anymore.</i>

391
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:34,250
<i>It wants to stay.</i>

392
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:42,333
<i>The Empire is a disease
that thrives in darkness,</i>

393
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:45,666
<i>it is never more alive than when we sleep.</i>

394
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:53,083
<i>It's easy for the dead
to tell you to fight,</i>

395
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:56,125
<i>and maybe it's true,
maybe fighting is useless.</i>

396
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,625
<i>Perhaps it's too late.</i>

397
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:06,916
<i>But I'll tell you this...</i>

398
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:11,333
<i>If I could do it again,</i>

399
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:18,291
<i>I'd wake up early
and be fighting these bastards...</i>

400
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:19,750
Move!

401
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:22,500
<i>...from the start.</i>

402
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,166
<i>Fight the Empire!</i>

403
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,625
Enough!

404
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,333
No!

405
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,791
Placement!

406
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,791
Let him through!
Hold the line!

407
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,833
Let him through!

408
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:02,458
Let him through!

409
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,458
Let him through.
Hold the line!

410
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:05,833
Hold the line!

411
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,458
Hold the line!

412
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:16,833
You! Bell tower, make it stop now!

413
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:18,416
Go!

414
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,833
Hold the line!

415
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,291
I dreamt you came back.

416
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,041
Bix?

417
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:36,916
You climbed over a wall.

418
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:43,458
Hey, listen, we gotta get outta here.

419
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:45,041
Maarva was here.

420
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:50,666
Wasn't she great?

421
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,750
Get him up!

422
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:10,250
Move, move!

423
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:16,625
There's no one out there. Come on.

424
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:19,375
They'll get angry.

425
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:22,625
No.

426
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,083
Ah!

427
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,208
Oh, my God...

428
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,500
Come. Come.

429
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:28,750
There you go.

430
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:35,708
Come on, let's get moving. Come on.

431
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,416
Keep moving!

432
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:41,500
There! That's him!

433
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:42,708
Get him!

434
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:50,250
- Hold the line!
- Open fire!

435
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:53,750
Fire at will!

436
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,958
Come on!

437
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:14,041
- Move!
- Get him!

438
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,375
Ah!

439
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:27,041
Ah!

440
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:54,875
You.

441
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:57,541
What are you doing here?

442
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:27,708
Okay.

443
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,416
Do as I say. Move!

444
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,125
Straight ahead. Through the door.

445
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,458
Quickly!

446
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:50,708
You?

447
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:53,250
How?

448
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,250
You were in trouble.

449
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:04,791
Syril.

450
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:05,916
I knew that.

451
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:15,583
I should...

452
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:17,166
I should say thank you.

453
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:20,458
You don't have to.

454
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,208
What about this?

455
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,583
Everything goes.

456
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,541
- Closet?
- Empty.

457
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:57,625
- You're bleeding.
- It's fine.

458
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:58,708
That's blood.

459
00:43:58,791 --> 00:43:59,791
It's nothing.

460
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,625
It's not mine.

461
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:11,125
Come on, guys.

462
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:12,666
The fuel gauge says zero.

463
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,208
I've got nothing.

464
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:17,541
It's topped out. It's reading full.

465
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,765
Do you wanna come up here and see?

466
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:22,750
Bang the gauge, Jezz.
Just give it a whack.

467
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:28,583
It's got a few kinks,
but it's a good old ship.

468
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,500
I'd have more confidence
if you were coming.

469
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:33,791
It flies.

470
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:37,625
Pull it! Pull it!

471
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:40,958
We're full!

472
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:45,958
Give me those.

473
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:49,000
Now, go.
You go now or forget it.

474
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:50,791
No.

475
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:01,416
C-C-Cassian.

476
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:04,208
- Get it going!
- Almost there.

477
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:07,458
Hey.

478
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:10,375
- Help her up.
- Brasso.

479
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,541
She's coming around. Come on.

480
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,041
Let's get moving!

481
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:17,291
Come. Come with me.

482
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,583
- Hey, Jezz.
- Hey, Cass.

483
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:26,250
Can they make it to Gangi Moon?

484
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,833
If they ever make it out of here.

485
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:29,958
You're not coming?

486
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,875
Stay low all the way to Farside Sea.

487
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:35,291
The moment you get over the water,
you climb.

488
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:38,500
Straight home, full pump,
hand throttle, no comms.

489
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,833
All in. You understand?

490
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:43,166
Yeah.

491
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,791
You're n-n-not coming?

492
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,500
Not today, Bee.

493
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:48,875
I n-n-never got to see you.

494
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,125
You take care of Bix until I get there.

495
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,250
I'm counting on you.

496
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,666
You always say that.

497
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:58,500
And you always come through.

498
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:01,375
Get them out of here!

499
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:03,166
He'll find us.

500
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:08,416
Cassian will find us.

501
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:12,583
I will.

502
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:21,416
I'll find you.

503
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:24,958
Now, go! Go, go!

504
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:00,625
Prepare for evac.

505
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:01,708
Full stealth.

506
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:28,083
You came here to kill me, didn't you?

507
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:31,375
You don't make it easy.

508
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:36,375
I will now.

509
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:55,333
What game is this?

510
00:48:57,625 --> 00:48:58,625
No game.

511
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:04,583
Kill me.

512
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:09,458
Or take me in.
