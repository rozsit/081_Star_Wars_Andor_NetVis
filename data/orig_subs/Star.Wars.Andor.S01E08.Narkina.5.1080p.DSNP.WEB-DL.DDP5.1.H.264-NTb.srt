1
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:06,125
They're in.

2
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:11,601
<i>- We're getting out of here.</i>
- To go where?

3
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:12,625
Anywhere we want.

4
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,625
I got lucky.

5
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,166
I've got enough credits
to get us anywhere.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,958
We're treating what happened
at Aldhani like a robbery.

7
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,583
What would you call it?

8
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,208
An announcement.

9
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,458
You realize what you've set in motion?

10
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,166
People will suffer.

11
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,375
That's the plan.

12
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,833
<i>I hope she's worth it.</i>

13
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,333
<i>Well, we'll see, won't we?</i>

14
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,875
We can't hide forever.

15
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:41,125
I can now prove a link between the theft
of our most secret equipment

16
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,625
and its distribution
to rebel groups across the galaxy.

17
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:47,666
For the moment, I'm reassigning
the Morlana Sector to Supervisor Meero.

18
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,875
Ferrix is of great interest to her

19
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,208
and has clearly
become a distraction for you.

20
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,041
<i>As long as everyone
thinks I'm an irritation,</i>

21
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,291
<i>they might miss what I'm really doing.</i>

22
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,666
What are you really doing?

23
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,000
Raising money.

24
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,291
Raising money for what?

25
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,625
I'm not going.

26
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,166
What are you talking about?

27
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,250
You can't stay, and I can't go.

28
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,583
<i>Morlana One.</i>

29
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,291
I fully intend to clear my name
and have my record expunged.

30
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,291
Why don't we start that process now?

31
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,541
<i>There's a rebel murderer
running free</i>

32
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,000
<i>because of corruption and laxity
in the authority.</i>

33
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,791
Hang onto this one for me.

34
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:27,750
Six years.

35
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:28,875
Six years?

36
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:30,666
No, no, wait!

37
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,458
Change of guidelines.

38
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,958
I didn't do anything!

39
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,125
Wait. I'm just a tourist!

40
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,458
Get in line!

41
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,250
Move it!

42
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,541
Don't you look at me!

43
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,333
Move it!

44
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,576
Keep moving!

45
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,666
Up the stairs!

46
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,166
Pick it up!

47
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,125
Name?

48
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,291
Tuck Hybecks.

49
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,291
- Home planet?
- Galdi.

50
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,333
Belsavis. Next.

51
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,625
Name?

52
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,125
Girgo. Keef Girgo.

53
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,041
- Home planet?
- Deris-plata.

54
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,208
Narkina Five.

55
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,583
What? What's that?

56
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,958
Get to your transport.

57
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,333
- Next.
- What is that?

58
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,666
What's Narkina Five?

59
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,833
I'm a tourist!

60
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,000
Move it.

61
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,851
- Home planet?
- Giermos.

62
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,333
Belsavis.

63
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,458
Right there.

64
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,083
On you go.

65
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,750
Come on, move it, move it.

66
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,083
Anywhere, come on, sit down!

67
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:08,791
Right, shoes off!

68
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,416
Boots, sandals, everything on the floor!

69
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Toss it in!

70
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,916
Come on, move it, bare feet, let's go!

71
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,541
I'm Lieutenant Dedra Meero.

72
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,333
I'm the ISB Supervisor
for the Morlana Sector.

73
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,416
What happened to Lieutenant Blevin?

74
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,875
I'll ask the questions.

75
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,666
Ferrix. I've been reviewing the incident.

76
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,666
I was planning on calling you in
to fill some gaps in the report.

77
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,208
We were scheduling that.

78
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,375
But now, we've both
had our mornings interrupted

79
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,750
because you keep requesting
the Bureau of Standards Data Center

80
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,541
to look for Cassian Andor.

81
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,625
You've claimed
he was a missing fuel specialist,

82
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,750
an unresponsive energy engineer,

83
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:16,291
a fuel purity field officer
suspected of forging Imperial reports.

84
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:20,416
You've been here for less than a month
and you've filed five false inquiries.

85
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,625
Six, actually.

86
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,333
I wasn't counting this morning.

87
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,333
What are you doing, Mr. Karn?

88
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,458
Cassian Andor is a murderer
and a threat to the Empire.

89
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,625
I have been trying, with the limited
tools available, to find him.

90
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,958
So, this is about public safety?

91
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,708
Here's what's happened, Syril.

92
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,333
You have engaged the curiosity of the ISB.

93
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,666
Now, is there anything
you'd care to tell me

94
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,500
before I waste more of my time
figuring out what it is you are up to?

95
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm just trying to clear my name.

96
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,791
One would think
you'd want to leave Ferrix far behind.

97
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,916
One would be wrong.

98
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,958
I have a busy day.

99
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,083
Tell me, what's not in Lieutenant Blevin's
report that I need to know?

100
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,916
I have no idea.
I wasn't allowed to see the report.

101
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,500
- You signed it.
- I was given no choice.

102
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,291
We should be upstairs by now.

103
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,208
Give him Blevin's report, let him read it.

104
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,250
- Keep him in there.
- Of all days?

105
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,583
We have time.

106
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,083
This is an Imperial Starpath unit.

107
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,583
It was stolen
from the Steergard Naval yard last year.

108
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,250
We don't know when it was taken

109
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,500
because Steergard
was afraid to disclose its theft

110
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,291
and thought they could hide its absence.

111
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,833
My full report highlights the prevalence
of this problem galaxy-wide.

112
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,166
I'm listening.

113
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:53,125
This unit was found last month
on Ferrix in the Morlana One Sector.

114
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,958
The thief was a local named Cassian Andor.

115
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:59,625
He was wanted for the murder
of two Corporate Security officers.

116
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:04,083
The Starpath was left behind as he escaped
the tactical team sent in to arrest him.

117
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:11,583
Andor was in the act of transferring
the unit to a person we've named Axis

118
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,125
because of his centrality
to what we believe to be

119
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:18,041
an organized rebel effort
to acquire specialized Imperial gear.

120
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,958
This is quite the wishlist.

121
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,625
Full planetary comnet,
full Garrison tech package,

122
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:29,166
Series Nine Spectrum surveillance,
local agent funding, Code Droid.

123
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,833
All ready to go, sir.

124
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,625
If someone there is talking,
we need to be listening.

125
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,041
It's a large investment.

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,458
It's a fraction of the price
of lost technology.

127
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:46,500
So, drill down on Ferrix,
find this thief, and then what?

128
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,750
Identify Axis.

129
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,000
They escaped together.

130
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,041
It's the first best lead we've had.

131
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,291
Supervisor Meero has convinced me

132
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,000
that this Axis has been nimble

133
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,500
in spreading his activities
across the galaxy.

134
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,916
And, no, we don't know who he is,
nor do we know the scope of our problem.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,375
The little we are aware
of is already troubling.

136
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,375
Ferrix was a mistake.

137
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,500
It's the first one he's made.

138
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,583
Drill down is exactly
what I want to do, sir.

139
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:21,166
Drill down, find Andor,
and get a hunt started.

140
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,708
All right, move!

141
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,541
Go!

142
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,041
Down the ramp!

143
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,083
Down the ramp, now!

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Move it!

145
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,750
Stay right there!

146
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,375
On program!

147
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,750
Hands behind heads, feet down!

148
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,875
Breathe deep, brother.

149
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,541
This may be the last fresh air
we ever taste.

150
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,583
Welcome to Narkina Five.

151
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,666
This is an Imperial factory facility.

152
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,458
You've all been assessed as labor-worthy.

153
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,458
Now, following this introduction,

154
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,250
you'll be transferred
to your level assignment and workroom,

155
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,250
where your floor manager
will explain the details

156
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,958
of our schedule and expectations.

157
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,458
Your length of stay
has been predetermined.

158
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,666
The quality of that time
will be up to you.

159
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:46,875
Now, those who've been incarcerated
before will be surprised by the calm,

160
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:52,208
sanitary conditions, and our minimally
invasive enforcement techniques.

161
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,625
Well, I'm sure some,
if not all of you, are wondering,

162
00:10:56,708 --> 00:11:00,125
how we risk standing
before you without weapons?

163
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,708
It's a potent question.

164
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:06,583
And hopefully, one you won't need
to have answered very often, but...

165
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,416
You may stand.

166
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,458
That was level one of three.

167
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,125
Our floors are Tunqstoid steel.

168
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,333
Do your time productively,
keep to your lane,

169
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,500
and this needn't be more than a memory.

170
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,541
Good luck to you.

171
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,625
Up!

172
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,208
Line up! Single file!

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Up!

174
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,458
Let's go!

175
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,000
You've read the report?

176
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,125
Worse than I feared.

177
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,875
Criminal negligence
of my commanding officer,

178
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,375
the total lack
of Imperial authority on Ferrix,

179
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,916
the fact that Andor obviously had
an organized local cadre of accomplices.

180
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,833
None of that is here.

181
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,583
Let's talk about
the accomplice you encountered.

182
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:14,041
You told Lieutenant Blevin that Andor was
in the company of an older man,

183
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,625
tall, wearing a cloak.

184
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,125
What's not in here?

185
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,750
Uh...

186
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,875
Grey cloak, grey green.

187
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,541
Dark boots.

188
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,125
I didn't get a good look.

189
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,708
Uh...

190
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,041
I heard his voice, I'd recognize it.

191
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,375
Here's what we'll do, Mr. Karn.

192
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,083
You'll stop filing requests for Andor.

193
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,250
Anticipating that,
I will inform the Bureau of Standards

194
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,875
that you were of service
to the Empire today.

195
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,583
I was a good deputy inspector!

196
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,083
I was very good.

197
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,750
I solved a double murder
and found the killer in two days.

198
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,208
I was overly ambitious, yes,

199
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,958
but time was slipping away,
and the opportunity was real.

200
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,291
Service to the Empire, you just said it.

201
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,208
Can one ever be too aggressive
in preserving order?

202
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,750
I didn't deserve what happened.

203
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,083
I wish you luck.

204
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,166
I'm running late.

205
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,708
It's clear you need Andor
in order to find his partner.

206
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:27,583
This is more important than the death
of two Corporate Security guards.

207
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,041
I could be a valuable asset going forward.

208
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:39,500
Raise the alarm one more time,
and it won't be me you're speaking to.

209
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,041
Forget this happened.

210
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,623
Stop right there.

211
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
On program.

212
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:19,000
That means, hands on head,
eyes front, feet on the floor.

213
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,083
Do it.

214
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,250
Zap rod.

215
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,166
If I have to use it, you'll remember it.

216
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,916
Yes? Yes?

217
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,083
What's goin' on? Where's your partner?

218
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,625
They had a tech problem on One.

219
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,892
Delivery takes priority
over tech, you know that.

220
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,375
He'll be here any second.

221
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,666
New man ready on five-two-D,
requesting units override.

222
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,142
<i>Copy that. Coming up.</i>

223
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,916
That's not good.
This was on the schedule.

224
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,375
- He can't just not turn up.
- He'll be here.

225
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,791
<i>Override engaged.
Five-two, you have the floor.</i>

226
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,434
We've got deliveries' waiting.

227
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,916
- Eyes front.
- Let's just get him out on the Ring.

228
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,333
Step forward, let's go, move.

229
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,666
Step forward and stop, now, move.

230
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,041
Stop.

231
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,125
Eyes front, I said.

232
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,625
Sorry, I had to wait.

233
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,041
They were short-handed.

234
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,083
They had to pull a guy out from Four.
I came as quick as I could.

235
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,708
Post up. We're already behind.

236
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,215
- We good?
- Yes, you can go.

237
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,625
- Ready on the floor?
- Looks good.

238
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,916
Prep for door.

239
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,208
<i>On program.</i>

240
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,208
Step on to the lift and stop.

241
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,750
- Move forward.
- New man on the floor!

242
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,250
- Move.
- Hold your positions.

243
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,833
Step on there and stop.

244
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,791
Step off, move.

245
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,333
I said, step off, now!

246
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,458
Move!

247
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,208
This is Unit Five-Two-D.

248
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,708
Level five, room two,
the D is for Day shift.

249
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,916
Seven levels of factory,
seven rooms per level,

250
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,333
seven tables per room,
seven men, each table.

251
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,208
My name is Kino Loy.

252
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,083
I'm the Five-Two-D unit manager.

253
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,541
The forty-nine men
in this room answer to me.

254
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,833
Name.

255
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:31,916
Keef.

256
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,458
Keef Girgo.

257
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,083
He won't be back.

258
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:40,291
They only come to pick up the dead
and bring their replacements.

259
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,500
You're mine now.

260
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,583
Off program!

261
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,041
Back to work!

262
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:47,833
Listen up.

263
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,708
It's a 12-hour shift.

264
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:56,791
Productivity is encouraged,
evaluation is constant.

265
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,916
You have been assigned table five,

266
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,125
which is the pod that is behind

267
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,750
because you're not on the line
doing your job.

268
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,458
- Can you read?
- Yeah.

269
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,791
You see in the main boxes,
one through seven,

270
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:13,041
those are the scores for the tables
in this room, on this shift.

271
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,416
What's your table number?

272
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,291
Five.

273
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,416
There you go, table five.

274
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,708
See it? At the bottom?

275
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,541
Last place. That's you.

276
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,125
The seven tallies are the running shift

277
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,083
totals of all the other rooms
on this floor.

278
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,333
You play against
all the other tables in this room,

279
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,291
I play against all the other rooms.

280
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,250
- Play?
- Call it what you will,

281
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:39,791
the point of this conversation is that
you understand one thing most clearly.

282
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:44,458
I have 249 days left of my sentence.

283
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,791
I have a free hand in how I run this room.

284
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,250
I'm used to being
in the top three on the level.

285
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,791
You will wanna keep that happening.

286
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,500
I'm sensing you understand me.

287
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,875
Sick, injured, you talk to me.

288
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,000
Problems with another inmate,
I'll know before you do.

289
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,875
Losing hope, your mind,
keep it to yourself.

290
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,458
Don't ever slow up my line.

291
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,208
Table five.

292
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,083
Table five!

293
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,208
Table five?

294
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,416
Yeah, we've been waiting.
What do we call you?

295
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,666
Keef.

296
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,541
I'm Jemboc. Welcome.

297
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,208
Xaul.

298
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,166
Taga.

299
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,250
Ulaf.

300
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,541
Ham.

301
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,250
And this is Melshi.

302
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,375
We're down ten.

303
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,316
- We're a man short, he'll give us a pass.
- He should.

304
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,892
- He won't.
- He's done it before.

305
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,708
- That was months ago.
- We're down ten. You're dreaming.

306
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,601
- He's done it before.
- We're wasting time.

307
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,291
Down 12 before you know it.

308
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,083
They give us a new man
with only an hour left?

309
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,208
Forty-two minutes,
come on, boys, we can rally.

310
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,458
- They're up there, laughing.
- Don't.

311
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,583
- Melshi's right.
- We're wasting time.

312
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,166
Jem thinks Kino's in charge.

313
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,625
Hey, new guy, prepare to fry.

314
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,666
- Keef.
- What?

315
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,291
It's his name. Right?

316
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,250
Keef.

317
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,666
Work!

318
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,583
- Ham's right, get to it.
- Fly.

319
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,208
Stand back.

320
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,291
Watch what I do, exactly what I do.

321
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,083
You'll be where I am this time tomorrow.

322
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,791
With seven men, I'm the Swing,

323
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,541
I'll be feeding the table
so it might be a little different...

324
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,333
- He's on the box.
- They're callin' him.

325
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,375
No.

326
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,416
<i>Five-Two-D shift
productivity levels are unacceptable.</i>

327
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,916
<i>We're calling a new clock.</i>

328
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,125
Okay, listen up!

329
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,958
This will be a sprint segment.

330
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,375
39 minutes on the tone.

331
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:43,291
<i>As ever, the least
productive table will be disciplined.</i>

332
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,708
- Hands away.
- Clear.

333
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,625
Come on, boys.

334
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,375
Let's go, let's go.

335
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,208
Come on, come on, come on.

336
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,125
Get busy, or get fried!

337
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,958
Keep it going!

338
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,708
Not for me.

339
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:45,833
I'll have hers.

340
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,291
You used to like it.

341
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,708
I was just better at pretending.

342
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,166
Well, that I find hard to believe.

343
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,250
<i>Sagrona.</i>

344
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,583
- What are we toasting?
- A quick night.

345
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,625
Hmm. I'll drink to that.

346
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,750
So, the evening's agenda?

347
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,750
I need votes to stall
the Emperor's latest overreach.

348
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,416
Hello, Tay.

349
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,416
Tay Kolma, how prompt you are.

350
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,541
Perrin.

351
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,041
Still in town, or commuting?

352
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,875
- Bit of both.
- Something to drink?

353
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,333
What are we having?

354
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,458
Taste of home, eh? I'll have one.

355
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,625
Make it three.

356
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,041
I'm fine, thank you.

357
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,416
- Mon is working.
- Well, there's much to be done.

358
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,541
I don't think
you're on the menu tonight, Tay.

359
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,958
The Senator is pitching politics,
not charity.

360
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,625
Saving the Empire from the Emperor.

361
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,125
Do you remember Perrin at 15?

362
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,208
Oh, let's not.

363
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,875
The academy firebrand.

364
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,642
- Two squigs again, sir?
- Please.

365
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,875
How things change, eh?

366
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,125
The new legislation
is definitely having an effect.

367
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,500
The rebels might have thought that over
before blowing up Aldhani.

368
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,375
Thank you.

369
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,458
<i>Sagrona.</i>

370
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,666
<i>Sagrona teema.</i>

371
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,916
Well, good luck, feeding
the galaxy. I'm off to feed myself.

372
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,291
Charity begins at home.

373
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,041
I was hoping you'd come.

374
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,541
I wish I had better news.

375
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,166
I'm about to get very busy.

376
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,708
The new banking regulations
are making life difficult.

377
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,875
- Difficult or impossible?
- I don't know.

378
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:11,375
They're staffing up Imperial auditors,
we'll see where they are placed.

379
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,083
Is there anything we can do?

380
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,500
That has its own risks.

381
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,083
Leida.

382
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,041
- Uh, we've met.
- Indeed.

383
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,625
You're here all the time now.

384
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,958
Learning to love Coruscant.

385
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,875
Your father's looking for you.

386
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,250
You're drinking squigs?

387
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,916
No, I've lost my taste for it.

388
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's disgusting.

389
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,125
That's the point.

390
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,416
I should find Dad.

391
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,750
Nice to see you again.

392
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,666
What about the money I've moved already?

393
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,166
Not everything's tucked away.

394
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,791
We'll find a way to explain it.

395
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,333
So, we've given up on hiding it?

396
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,083
How much are we worrying about?

397
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,458
Four hundred thousand.

398
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,083
Senator.

399
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,708
Hi! I was just coming to get you.

400
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,625
Perrin said you were hoarding the squigs.

401
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,000
I always forget
you're Chandrilan at heart.

402
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,458
And I always forget how sweet you are
when you're looking for votes.

403
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,208
Keep it down!

404
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:36,416
Keep it down!

405
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,500
Line up!

406
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,208
Let's go!

407
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,458
Palpatine's frustrating,
yes, we agree.

408
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:26,875
Too easily provoked? Yes.

409
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:29,000
Overreactive, but...

410
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,125
Understatement.

411
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,291
Says what he means.

412
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:34,541
We're discussing legislation,
not speeches.

413
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:35,750
What does he mean?

414
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,000
What is public order?

415
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,750
It's an awfully big box, isn't it?

416
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:42,375
The Emperor's primary charge
is to protect us, is it not?

417
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:45,125
And that's what the P.O.R.D.
legislation will do.

418
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:47,083
How much protection is enough?

419
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:49,000
We know what too little looks like.

420
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,875
Surveillance and prosecution
without limit.

421
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,291
If you're doing nothing wrong,
what is there to fear?

422
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,333
I'm fearing your definition of wrong.

423
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:57,875
These are dangerous times.

424
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:00,125
- Dangerous times?
- Are they not?

425
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,416
Do you feel under threat?

426
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,916
Personally? Here, yes.

427
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,333
I'm at great risk of ingesting too much
of this nourishing Chandrilan hospitality.

428
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,958
This is our block.

429
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,041
You see the white lights?
That's the floor.

430
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,833
White is cold, red is hot.

431
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:33,666
The white lights start flashing,
you got seven seconds to get to your cell.

432
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,250
Sensors in the floor, two men in one cell,
it's an instant fry.

433
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,125
Fall out!

434
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:41,541
Fall out, fall out, fall out.

435
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,833
- Jem, walk the new man.
- Yeah.

436
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:46,083
Okay, Kino.

437
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,041
Come on.

438
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,375
This is you.

439
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,833
Your rack.

440
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:56,333
Everything you need here is on the wall.

441
00:25:56,416 --> 00:26:02,791
Water, night light, toilet flips down,
got a plate, spoon, and shaver.

442
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,166
And food?

443
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,083
The tube.

444
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,541
You can get as much as you want.

445
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,083
They like us healthy and fueled.

446
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:14,166
Don't worry, you'll learn to eat it.

447
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:18,250
Tough way to start,
getting fried twice in one day.

448
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:23,458
But perhaps in a few shifts,
we can pull a winner.

449
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,708
Winner gets taste with their food.

450
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,208
Top table wins flavor.

451
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:31,500
Last place gets fried.

452
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:38,583
Right, this will be cleaned every day,
and that is your tab.

453
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
What did you do?

454
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,375
Nothing.

455
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:47,500
Lot of that lately.

456
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:51,708
At least you know where you stand
from the start, no surprises.

457
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,500
Ask him already.

458
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,458
They doubled everyone's number last month.

459
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,583
P-O-R-D.

460
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:01,291
- People must be talkin' about it.
- About what?

461
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,800
The Public Order
Resentencing Directive.

462
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,166
It's been a tough month here
waiting for news.

463
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,208
Can't help but wonder
what people are saying.

464
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,916
He's never heard of it.

465
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,583
- He never heard of it.
- Told you.

466
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:18,625
The Public Order Decree.

467
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:19,958
The resentencings.

468
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,583
- I'm sorry.
- All the rebel activity.

469
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:25,041
- It's rebel nonsense.
- I don't know anything about it.

470
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,958
- They slaughtered a garrison.
- That's not what he said.

471
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:29,875
- They burned it down.
- Does it matter?

472
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:31,750
We're the ones getting punished.

473
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,208
But this guy never heard of it.

474
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:35,791
Don't ever look at the number.

475
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:37,708
- Double, triple, it doesn't matter.
- Hey!

476
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,958
You're here 'til they don't want you.
Understand?

477
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:41,208
Enough! Melshi!

478
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:43,083
Getting out now is just a dream.

479
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:44,875
Those days are over.

480
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,375
I said, that's enough.

481
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:52,291
<i>Return to
your cells immediately.</i>

482
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:54,458
<i>Thirty seconds on red floor.</i>

483
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,166
You don't walk in your sleep, do you?

484
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:04,375
What?

485
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,291
You'll find out.

486
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:07,375
Tighten up!

487
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:09,166
Hot floor!

488
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,916
Oh, you should ask my wife.
I never look out the window.

489
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,916
Ah! Here she is.

490
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Your embassy hostess.

491
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:07,291
The question was,

492
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:10,500
how many hours a day
do we stand here admiring the view?

493
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,291
We should. I know.

494
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,958
Not enough!

495
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:16,166
I think I'd never leave.

496
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,916
Well, that's always the way, isn't it?

497
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,750
One forgets to savor the familiar.

498
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:20,833
So true.

499
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:22,250
We came here as children.

500
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:25,666
- To visit?
- No, Mon became a Senator at 16.

501
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,916
So this is where you met?

502
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,291
No, we'd already been married a year.

503
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:30,833
That's so romantic.

504
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:31,916
And traditional.

505
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:33,875
The old ways of Chandrila.

506
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:35,333
As was the custom.

507
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:36,750
To each people its own.

508
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:39,875
Speaking of, have you seen Tay?

509
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:41,666
No, he left.

510
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,416
He said he had an early morning.

511
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,541
Well, of course.

512
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,666
Excuse me if you will.

513
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,000
So nice to meet you.

514
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:51,083
I'm going to spend more time
at this window, I promise you.

515
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,458
Tighten up!

516
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:24,458
Flight.

517
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,166
Three's off two, they're at 18.

518
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:32,208
Four is struggling.

519
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:34,166
Flight.

520
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,250
Hands away.

521
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,708
- Clear.
- Clear.

522
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:40,291
Away!

523
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,416
- Flight!
- Clear!

524
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:47,541
All right, come on, come on, come on.

525
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:51,625
Ready?

526
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,416
- I think so.
- It's tight.

527
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
Flip it.

528
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:05,833
- Ready up?
- Ready up.

529
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:07,250
Well, hang on, hang on.

530
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,250
- You okay?
- Pin jam.

531
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:10,916
Xaul, help him.

532
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah. Come on, mate.

533
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,375
Hey!

534
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:22,750
You just takin' a breather?

535
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:24,458
Come on, guys!

536
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:26,500
You got a chance of winning
the shift today!

537
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:28,833
Be a shame to waste it.

538
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:30,791
Keef.

539
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,916
Keef!

540
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,416
- Yeah.
- Yes!

541
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,625
Drill in!

542
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:04,333
It's not complaining
if you tell me what's going on.

543
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,416
Oh, you're freezing!

544
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:09,833
My mother was a whiner
and that'll cure you.

545
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:14,750
I'm just trying to figure out
if you need a doctor or not.

546
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,791
She has p-p-pain in the knee.

547
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,625
The doctor was here yesterday.

548
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,875
Your breathing sounds weak.

549
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,250
You got dizzy again.

550
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,791
What have you done now?

551
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:29,375
Apparently I'm throwing a party.

552
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,666
I heard the boys
had to carry you back here.

553
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,375
Oh! Word travels fast.

554
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:34,458
She fell.

555
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:44,166
<i>What was she doing by the hotel?</i>

556
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:46,458
She's obsessed with Troopers.

557
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,625
She fell trying to pry open
the old Rix flood gate.

558
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:52,541
- She gonna flush them out?
- No.

559
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:56,291
She wanted to see if the tunnel
under the hotel was still open.

560
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:58,416
Why?

561
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,833
So the Rebellion can sneak in
and take them by surprise.

562
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:04,958
She's a Rebel.

563
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,375
I should be coming by more often.

564
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:11,875
She's not your mother.

565
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,041
Or yours.

566
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:18,208
- She can't stay here much longer.
- Good luck with that.

567
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:19,958
What about the Daughters of Ferrix?

568
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,416
She's a past president.

569
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,125
They must have a warm room somewhere.

570
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,208
They've tried.

571
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:25,791
She's made her wishes clear.

572
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:30,375
Cassian.

573
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,125
You really don't know where he is?

574
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,375
Where did you go?

575
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:51,541
Who's the big one?

576
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:53,416
I've no idea.

577
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:56,750
Where were you?
I was about to come lookin'.

578
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:58,833
Cold now.

579
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:03,958
What?

580
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:07,083
There's a room to rent around the corner.

581
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,666
They have a sign up.

582
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,125
Can't just stay here.

583
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,208
I can.

584
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,083
Alone?

585
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,250
Two of us would draw too much attention.

586
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,625
You'll stay here and wait?

587
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,833
Just hope he shows up?

588
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:21,708
- Could be anywhere.
- This is all we have.

589
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:22,875
What's the alternative?

590
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,250
Haven't we been apart long enough?

591
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,875
It's not about us.

592
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,916
After what we've been through?

593
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:35,333
You think the Empire
stops to catch its breath?

594
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,666
This is a fight to the death, Vel.

595
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:43,541
Who would you say you are?

596
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:49,083
Maybe I'm a rich girl
running away from her family.

597
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,250
Well, that's cold.

598
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,125
Even for you.

599
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:59,583
I told you upfront
the struggle will always come first.

600
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:01,000
We take what's left.

601
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,791
I'm a mirror, Vel.

602
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:19,000
You love me because I show you
what you need to see.

603
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:22,958
Thank you.

604
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,125
Sure.

605
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,625
Well, I'll keep an eye.

606
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,041
Paak?

607
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:45,666
Are you as slow as I am?

608
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,833
Yeah, losing the hotel
is not good for business.

609
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:50,666
We need a meeting.
There's gotta be something we can do.

610
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,625
- What's up?
- I need to look for something in the back.

611
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,333
Not sure that's a good idea.

612
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:58,500
- It's been off for a while.
- It's urgent.

613
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,416
All right.

614
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,541
Kleya?

615
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Kleya?

616
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:44,208
It's the shop owner on Ferrix.

617
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:46,833
She's trying to find Cassian Andor.
His mother is ill.

618
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,708
We're not answering. We can't.

619
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,333
She could show the right direction.

620
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:54,416
She's asking us.

621
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,750
She knows more than we do.

622
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:57,416
So much more.
She might have a lead.

623
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,416
More likely
it's the ISB working her radio.

624
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,708
- You're guessing!
- And you're slipping!

625
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,541
We're shutting down Ferrix.

626
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:08,375
The code, the frequency, all of it.

627
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,791
I'm thinking clearly and you're not.

628
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,333
Tell me to shut it down.

629
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:18,875
It's Andor.

630
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:24,250
Knowing he's out there, knowing me,
not knowing what he knows.

631
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:27,875
I took him on the Fondor.

632
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:30,000
Was I insane?

633
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:32,458
You were desperate
for Aldhani to work and it did.

634
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:34,583
And we'll find him, just not like this.

635
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:36,000
Vel was out hunting.

636
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:37,166
She and Cinta.

637
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,166
- Are they in Ferrix yet?
- I'll have a listen.

638
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,166
We're being extremely careful with it.

639
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:44,333
The woman's name is Bix Caleen.

640
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:46,125
Vel could have a look if it's safe.

641
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:47,791
They know what they're doing.

642
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:52,583
I'm not slipping, Kleya.

643
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,208
I've just been hiding for too long.

644
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,416
It's all different now.

645
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,750
We're going loud.

646
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,750
Vulnerability is inevitable.

647
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:02,833
I'm not slipping.

648
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:04,791
I know.

649
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,541
I just need you to wake up.

650
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:08,166
There's a lot to do.

651
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:11,291
Shut it down.

652
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:31,541
Coordinate alternatives for Segra Milo.

653
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:32,665
<i>Calculating.</i>

654
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:34,833
<i>Four potential routes.</i>

655
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:36,500
Let's take the long way around.

656
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,541
<i>Re-routing Segra Milo.</i>

657
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,208
No, no, no, no!

658
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:04,291
Aw, man.

659
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:05,767
- Who is it now?
- No!

660
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:06,791
He railed it!

661
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:08,250
- Who?
- Veemoss!

662
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,416
Veemoss!

663
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,208
Table three, the tall one.

664
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:12,916
He fell! Or jumped!

665
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:15,541
Aw, man, well,
we'll be smellin' him all night.

666
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:17,333
Here? He rails it here?

667
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:18,976
He was slipping. You could see it.

668
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,708
I don't care, man.
You rail here at night, I got no sympathy.

669
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:22,791
Shut up about it.

670
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,642
You'll be shorthanded
all day tomorrow.

671
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:26,601
Think about that
when you're gettin' fried.

672
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,583
Enough! Let's quiet down!

673
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:30,916
<i>Level five, grid disruption.</i>

674
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,375
<i>You have ten seconds
to get to your sleeping platforms.</i>

675
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:51,708
Move, move, move!

676
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:55,916
What's going on?

677
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It's Paak's yard.

678
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:58,875
I'm not sure. They're all over it.

679
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:05,958
Detained for what?

680
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:08,416
Why won't you tell me?

681
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,333
Where are they taking my father?

682
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:12,125
Tell me! Where is he?

683
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:13,500
Where is my father?

684
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,416
- Shut him up!
- Silence!

685
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:21,416
- What's going on?
- They took Paak in last night.

686
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,458
- Where?
- The hotel. He never came home.

687
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:27,750
Get these people back. I want a perimeter.

688
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:30,291
Two and two, up and down, clear the lane!

689
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:31,375
Yes, sir!

690
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,791
- Let's go!
- You okay?

691
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:37,916
- I don't know.
- Move it.

692
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,916
Let's go, let's go!

693
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,166
Get out of the way!

694
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,083
Move it!

695
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,083
Caleen!

696
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:51,250
Bix Caleen!

697
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:54,083
That's your name, isn't it?

698
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:57,000
If not, the resemblance is quite striking.

699
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:58,500
Get to Zorby's. Run!

700
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:00,666
Get her!

701
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,541
- Move! Move! Move!
- Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

702
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:05,166
Go!

703
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:12,166
Get her!

704
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:40,833
So, my friend,
the garrison at Aldhani, was that you?

705
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:43,333
I was just about to ask you
the same thing.

706
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:44,958
You'd never tell me if it was.

707
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:47,583
Somebody's sitting on some dosh.

708
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,833
If it's you,
I'm hoping you'll put it to good use.

709
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:51,958
Would I be out here in the cold

710
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,333
if I had just pinched
a 100 million credits?

711
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:56,083
That's exactly what you'd do.

712
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,750
And that's exactly
what I would say if I were you.

713
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:03,666
If you're trying to convince me
it was you, it's working.

714
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,750
Let's agree.

715
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:08,041
- It was a masterpiece.
- Well, now I'm sure.

716
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:15,416
Aren't you tired of playing
behind the scenes, Luthen?

717
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,291
Aren't you tired of fighting
with people who agree with you?

718
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:19,875
You come all this way to scold me?

719
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,250
Or did you bring me some toys?

720
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:24,625
Hmm.

721
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:26,208
I did, but they're not for free.

722
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:27,375
Nothing with you is free.

723
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:29,750
Not every operation is as flush as yours.

724
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:32,500
Tell me what you've got.

725
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:36,041
Well, how about a full set
of Imperial drive adapters?

726
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:39,291
I've also got three sealed
Steergard targeting deflectors.

727
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:40,541
Mmm.

728
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,375
You have this all here with you?

729
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:47,291
At what cost?

730
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:49,541
Anto Kreegyr.

731
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:53,291
- I want you to meet him.
- Anto Kreegyr?

732
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,083
He's been probing
the Imperial power station at Spellhaus.

733
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:57,916
He's found a weakness in the defenses.

734
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,625
It may take some time to work up,
but he's got an angle.

735
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:01,916
The man's an ox!

736
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,875
Slow! And stupid!

737
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:04,958
And strong.

738
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:07,375
I want you to hear his plan.
He'll need air support.

739
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:08,666
Let's just keep this simple.

740
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,458
I'll take all three deflectors. How much?

741
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:13,541
Well, you meet with Kreegyr, they're free.

742
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:15,541
- You don't, I won't sell.
- I work alone.

743
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,041
That's what I'm trying to change.

744
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:20,458
I'm not gonna put my people
at risk for someone else.

745
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:22,291
We need to pull together, Saw!

746
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,625
Whatever our final version
of success looks like,

747
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:29,500
there's no chance any of us
can make it real on our own.

748
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:31,875
We need the Empire to help.

749
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:33,125
We need them angry.

750
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:34,875
We need them coming down hard.

751
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:38,666
Oppression breeds rebellion.

752
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:41,333
Kreegyr needs air support.

753
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:43,000
- I'm not for hire.
- Think of it.

754
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,416
Think of Spellhaus in flames.

755
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,000
Neither of you could do it on your own,
but together...

756
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:51,083
Kreegyr's a separatist.

757
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,750
Maya Pei's a neo-Republican.

758
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:56,458
The Ghorman front.

759
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:58,166
The Partisan alliance?

760
00:45:58,875 --> 00:45:59,875
Sectorists.

761
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:01,500
Human cultists?

762
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:03,291
Galaxy partitionists.

763
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:04,416
They're lost!

764
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,333
All of them, lost!

765
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:08,666
Lost!

766
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,916
What are you, Luthen?

767
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:21,208
I've never really known.

768
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:24,666
What are you?

769
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:30,791
I'm a coward.

770
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,250
I'm a man who's terrified

771
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,625
the Empire's power
will grow beyond the point

772
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:37,583
where we can do anything to stop it.

773
00:46:37,666 --> 00:46:38,791
I'm the one who says,

774
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:42,541
"We'll die with nothing if we don't put
aside our petty differences."

775
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:43,666
Petty?

776
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:50,333
I am the only one with clarity of purpose.

777
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:56,208
Well, anarchy is a seductive concept.

778
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:01,333
A bit of a luxury I'd argue
to a man who is hiding in cold caves,

779
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:03,666
and begging for spare parts.

780
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:15,166
No sale today, Luthen.

781
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,416
Good luck with Anto Kreegyr.

782
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,083
She's on her way up.

783
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:37,750
Would you like us to clear the room?

784
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:38,833
No.

785
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,750
I want her to see him.

786
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:55,541
What are you doing?
Get him out of here.

787
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:58,291
- Quickly.
- You two, with me.

788
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:00,041
Now!

789
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:02,750
Paak.

790
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:06,375
Paak. Hey.

791
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,416
Hello, Bix.

792
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:33,505
- Let's go!
- Come on, come on!

793
00:48:33,541 --> 00:48:34,583
Hands away!

794
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:35,708
Clear!

795
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,166
Good?

796
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,291
All right.

797
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,166
Okay, ready?

798
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:46,375
- Bring it. Bring it in.
- Come on, boys, yes.

799
00:48:58,541 --> 00:48:59,958
It's good, it's good.
