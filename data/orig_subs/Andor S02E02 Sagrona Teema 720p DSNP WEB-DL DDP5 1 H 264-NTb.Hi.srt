00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,583
I'm sure you've heard
what it is by now.

161
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,457
Is it really a Chandi Merle?

162
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,582
Yeah, one of them.

163
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,583
It's a bit gross, don't you think? It's
probably worth more than the house.

164
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:02,542
- You'll want to put that in your speech.
- [chuckles]

165
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,708
Last night was successful.

166
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,625
- Two more to go.
- Mmm.

167
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:14,041
You should tell your
boyfriend to back off the nog.

168
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:15,957
And who's my boyfriend?

169
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,249
Oh. What have you done?

170
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,500
- Thrown him over?
- [scoffs]

171
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,499
I don't know who
we're talking about.

172
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,000
Tay Kolma. Is he not your lover?

173
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:26,999
Haven't heard that
nonsense in a while.

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,624
His wife has run off,
so the field is clear.

175
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,416
- He's all yours now.
- Stop.

176
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:34,333
Well, maybe you've all dropped him.
That would explain a great deal.

177
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:35,832
Like what?

178
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,833
It's always best to let them down
gently, or so I've been told.

179
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,542
We have a long day, Perrin.

180
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,000
Tay had a bit too much
First Night punch.

181
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,708
He had to be taken home.

182
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,166
I mean, it's a full-on
Chandi wedding.

183
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:54,292
He grew up four valleys
away, he should know better.

184
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,750
Pace yourself or pay the price.

185
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:00,958
He was always weak.

We're getting there.

194
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,708
I spoke to my friend
at Five Hundred.

195
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,791
She thinks they'll finish
inspecting up there today.

196
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,832
Where they go next should tell us
what direction they're moving, but...

197
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,124
How many are there?

198
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,249
[Kellen] On the ground?

199
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,332
She counted about 40. We don't
know what they have in the air.

200
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,167
- What if they come this way?
- Look, they need the grain.

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,874
They know we need help and
they know everyone isn't legal.

202
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,875
How hard they look,
what they do...

203
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,499
It's been ten years since the
last audit. Nobody's happy.

204
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,249
- Talia thinks they'd let us slide.
- We can't count on that.

205
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,874
- What if they ask where we came from?
- I wouldn't mention Ferrix.

206
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,292
- What if we stay ahead of them?
- [Kellen] I'd be careful.

207
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:29,749
They caught someone
running at Five Hundred.

- That's all that's left?

Look, six dry, eight wet.

I'd rather be hungry than sick.

they've gone very
quiet over there.

You need a perimeter.

I was just about to do that.

00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,042
We had a decent meal
there last night.

319
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,750
It's not that far.

320
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,708
It's a beautiful
ride over the fields.

321
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,708
I'm only here for
another couple of days.

322
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,833
Maybe you'd like to join me.

323
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm not sure my
husband would approve.

324
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:43,042
Ah.

325
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,792
Sorry to hear that.

326
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,458
Is he here?

327
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,417
He's off-planet for a few days.

328
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:53,958
Is he a mechanic as well?

329
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,167
A very good one.

330
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,792
Does he worry about you?

331
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,041
In what way?

332
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:05,542
We've just shut
down all the comms.

333
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,125
It's not up to
me. It's a policy.

334
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,874
We freeze the zone
during an audit.

335
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:15,292
It's supposed to stop things sneaking
away while we're doing all our counting.

336
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,708
That's good to know.

337
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:20,542
[Brasso] Zala.

338
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:23,542
[Bix] I'm done. You ready?

339
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:26,082
Yeah. Sorry.

340
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,167
[Krole] Hello.

341
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,208
What's your Council?

342
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,374
[Bix] We're based in 207.

343
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,833
[Brasso] We move around.
We go where there's a need.

344
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,792
Like this.

345
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,708
Well...

346
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,500
nice to meet you.

347
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,250
See you along the way.

351
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,375
[Perrin] I'd come up here with
my uncles. It was good hunting.

352
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,207
It was all private
back then, of course.

353
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,957
Signs up everywhere.
Keep the poachers out.

354
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,750
I remember the signs.

355
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:19,708
Didn't stop you.

356
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,042
I wasn't much for warnings.

357
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:26,000
Well, hasn't been bad for
business though, has it?

[Sculdun chuckles]

359
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,166
- I've always wanted to.
- I see.

360
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:31,417
Mother wouldn't allow it.

361
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,499
It'll be different now.

[Mon] Wedding

366
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:46,875
- It rained.
- [Vel] Ah. I remember.

367
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,458
Is Leida happy? Is this
really what she wants?

00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:53,250
Everything old is new again.

369
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:56,375
As if I needed another
reason to stay away.

370
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,208
What happens at the
top? I don't remember.

371
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,375
We gaze at the ancestral
lands. Some children sing.

372

The Elder waves her hand and
we'll all have been purified.

No.

Luthen knows, but
he won't tell me.

378
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,208
That's not acceptable.

379
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,708
If she wanted to
see me, she would.

380

It was never going
to be perfect.

I'm sorry.

What if they've grabbed him?

389
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,457
[Gerdis] We'd hear about it.

390
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,707
- I don't know about that.
- They could be messing with us.

391
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,291
Taking it to another level.

392
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:08,499
- How is that another level?
- Snatching him?

393
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,749
- If Plug was a hostage...
- [Snur] That changes everything.

How would that change anything?

395
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:15,791
We have the pilot.

396
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:18,332
They have a ship that
goes nowhere without us.

397
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,499
- They could have more food than we think.
- And you can't trust Plug with food.

398
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,791
He'd flip sides for a meal.

399
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:24,624
Yeah, he'd sure be at
the front of the line.

400
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:28,208
They don't have any food. Do
they have any food on that ship?

No.

402

It might not be now.

479
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:31,458
I still have several things
pending, it's just...

480
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:33,500
I have concerns.

481
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,167
The Foundation is
up and running.

482
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,791
Your financial blemishes
have been smoothed over

with how they've landed,

the risk I've taken on.

I'm shocked.

I'm sorry. I feel terrible.
I really had no idea.

491
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:12,166
Do you know, the irony is it's
the rebellion that's hurt me most.

492
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:15,500
Rebel activity soured
my investments.

You can see how I might feel...

494

this clear sooner.

Yeah, I should've.

499

Perhaps I thought
it was obvious.

Let me get through this weekend and
I promise we'll figure something out.

Indeed.

[Kellen] I chatted up one
of the soldiers today.

510
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,582
They're moving tomorrow.

511

[Bix] Where they headed?

512
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:28,207
It looks like they're going
to Three Hundred next,

513
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:29,542
but there's no guarantee.

514
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,957
What if we move behind
them to Five Hundred

515
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,457
and just wait till they're done?

516
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:35,832
Most of the arrests have
been people running.

517
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:36,957
There must be work there.

518
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:38,332
[Kellen] We can't move all this.

519
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:40,332
They want to know
who is living here.

520

I'll say it's me. I'm legal.

[Kellen] We're doing

Well, I suppose I have been
avoiding him. Now I know why.

Perrin said he had to be

So nothing specific.

Well, he's had some
bad investments.

It's very troubling.

Is there any chance
he'd go to Sculdun?

No, he wouldn't dare.
