1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,976
Revolution is not for the sane.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,630
<i>And yet... here we are.</i>

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,750
<i>Where are you, boy?</i>

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,106
You're here! You're not
with luthen. You're here!

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,420
You're right here, and
you're ready to fight!

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,146
Spiders are not the most
unique thing in ghorman.

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,436
There's a mineral underground. Doctor!

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,606
Deep substrate foliated kalkite.

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,896
Should we fail to find any alternatives,

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,356
we will have to control
ghorman with a hand firm enough

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,056
to silence any resistance.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,936
Grand moff tarkin killed 500
peaceful, unarmed ghormans

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,556
<i>in the middle of that Plaza.</i>

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,266
You can imagine how
upset we would be to find out

15
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:55,170
there's an imperial military facility
rising over the monument to the fallen.

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,976
Is that where it happened?

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,210
I was with my father.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,250
He was killed saving me.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,976
I can't support the bill because
I can't risk chafing the emperor.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,226
Why ghorman is being
persecuted so intently

21
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,646
are questions no one
seems prepared to answer.

22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,016
Hasn't there always been something
slightly arrogant about the ghor?

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,806
With the right ideas planted in the
right markets in the right sequence,

24
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,976
we can now weaponize
this galactic opinion.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,016
<i>Propaganda will only get you so far.</i>

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,606
You need a radical
insurgency you can count on.

27
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,710
You need ghorman rebels you
can depend on to do the wrong thing.

28
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,726
Luthen should have told
me you were in trouble.

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,080
We're worth more to him
separately than together.

30
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, that's something we'll
have to talk to him about.

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,920
- Jacquème! Jacquème!
- Lo stique sassor!

32
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,436
<i>Nache mik balor! Sim ro nache telpó!</i>

33
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not loving Coruscant.

34
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,540
It's overwhelming, I know you...

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,306
You've been struggling.

36
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,606
You come to the house
and you mess with bix?

37
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,396
You mess with her behind my back?

38
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,476
You realize what you're
putting at risk right now?

39
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,830
- I give you everything.
- This is everything?

40
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,460
Violating every protocol we live by?

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,556
<i>Bix has to pull it together.</i>

42
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,556
Or you<i> Will have to decide at what
point it becomes too large a problem.</i>

43
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,410
Whatever the mission is, I'm coming.

44
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,500
Shadow-six, you are
clear for open pad one.

45
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,500
Go for tower, 0-1-1.

46
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,646
Listen up! New rules!

47
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,726
No vouchers, no food, no rack until
you check in with your duty officer.

48
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,856
You'll find your duty officer
listed on the health certificate

49
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,317
waiting for you in the clinic
following your medical approval.

50
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:26,290
Stay to the group and
mind the freight paths.

51
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,960
Take your shirt off.

52
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,380
And don't tell me it's better.

53
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,356
- Turn around.
- I'm gonna be late.

54
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,710
What's more important?

55
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,106
Easy. Easy.

56
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,356
That was easy.

57
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,380
- Pick another spot.
- Just relax.

58
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,870
Yeah? What are you gonna do?

59
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,670
Anything I want.

60
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,290
Hey.

61
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,000
Look at this.

62
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,960
- I can come back.
- Don't you dare.

63
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,516
I was about to send a search party.

64
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,830
- Hey.
- Hey.

65
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,170
- When did you get back?
- Just now.

66
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,266
- Where have you been?
- I was on a repair.

67
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,646
It took a while getting back.

68
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,106
- You check in?
- Not yet.

69
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,062
Things are getting really
organized around here.

70
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:07,226
Tell me about it.

71
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,040
- Here.
- That's all right. I've got it. Thanks.

72
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,410
Back from where?

73
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,186
- Here and there.
- This is here.

74
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,766
I'm asking you where you were.

75
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,460
He just got in.

76
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,830
She's been more worried
about you than I have.

77
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,420
Thanks.

78
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,750
Where were you?

79
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,420
Luthen wants to know
if you're ready to work.

80
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,062
Ready for what?

81
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:48,410
He knows you were hurt.

82
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,910
If he does, it's because you told him.

83
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,630
He's been trying to reach you.

84
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,040
Ready for what?

85
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,160
He just wants to know
if he can count on you.

86
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,960
- Well, he's not making it easy.
- Whose fault is that?

87
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,356
You trust this place? All these people?

88
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,920
New faces every day?

89
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,766
We need an army.

90
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,936
Everything's a risk.

91
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,460
All we do here is get ready.

92
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,226
Luthen is making things happen.

93
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,420
Is he?

94
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,420
What do you want, wil?

95
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,760
You wanna fight?

96
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,590
Or you wanna win?

97
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,630
Going it alone doesn't cut it anymore.

98
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,556
Well, maybe you should tell him yourself.

99
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,410
Maybe you should tell
us where you've been.

100
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,266
The continued and
inexplicable ghorman resistance

101
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,896
to imperial norms.

102
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,106
Terrorism strikes again in ghorman.

103
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,556
Just three weeks after
events in corei and jel-novi,

104
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,646
there was a firebombing last
night at the naval terminal in palmo.

105
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,766
You can see, behind me,
vapor and thermal smoke

106
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,670
still rising from the site...

107
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,186
The number of imperial
casualties is still unknown.

108
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,896
Admiral tyzen is expected
to comment later today,

109
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,686
but we've already seen
an escalated response level.

110
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,356
Curfew was reinstated for the entire city.

111
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,476
Local leaders are urging calm,

112
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,936
and so far, there's been no
statement, or claim of credit,

113
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,016
from any local terrorist groups.

114
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,766
You can feel this city,

115
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,250
which was already on edge these
past few months, tightening up...

116
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,210
Ghorman? For luthen?

117
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,266
All these side runs. That's
what you've been doing?

118
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,356
It's being destroyed.

119
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,010
He must be thrilled.

120
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,750
He's wanted it long enough.

121
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,646
Dragging you out there? For what?

122
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,356
Help him torch the place?

123
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,710
It's not like that.

124
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,790
Not now.

125
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,620
It's the empire with the
torches. They've gone insane.

126
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,670
So?

127
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,210
What does he need me for?

128
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,976
Her.

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,170
Isb supervisor, dedra meero.

130
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,330
She destroyed ferrix.

131
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,120
She killed my father.

132
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,050
You know her.

133
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,556
She's there in ghorman.
In the open, I've seen her.

134
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,266
She's there now, and she's
there waiting to be killed,

135
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,500
and I know you're gonna
say it's for revenge, but it's not.

136
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,130
She's been coming
for luthen since ferrix.

137
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,436
She's been coming after him,

138
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,880
and you, and all of us,
and everyone we know.

139
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,250
She's just sitting there, cass.

140
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,500
She keeps winning.

141
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,726
You know she has to be stopped!

142
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,290
I'm late for my briefing.

143
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,710
You need to calm down, and check in.

144
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,580
You act like luthen's the enemy.

145
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,120
That would be easier.

146
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,380
She's a monster.

147
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,790
We won't have a better chance.

148
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,880
Sorry to keep you waiting.

149
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,000
<i>The emperor has taken a
great interest in the situation.</i>

150
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,436
Director krennic's still with him now,

151
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,516
but they wanted me to pass along the
affirmative message to you immediately.

152
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,870
<i>We are moving forward
with the original plan.</i>

153
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,226
There is, apparently,
no suitable replacement

154
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,080
or synthetic alternative for
the ghorman substrate material.

155
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,517
I see.

156
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,806
It's not for lack of effort.

157
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,516
Krennic's had the lab in
eadu working overtime all year.

158
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,330
I don't know the science, but...

159
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,090
It's bad luck ghorman.

160
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,396
<i>We need what's in the
ground, and when we're done,</i>

161
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,170
<i>there won't be much left to call "home."</i>

162
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,187
When?

163
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:31,670
The fleet will be fully
positioned in 48 hours.

164
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,266
<i>They're fiddling with the calendar,</i>

165
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,396
<i>but to commence a
full-enforced resettlement</i>

166
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,896
<i>that fits krennic's schedule,</i>

167
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,000
we'll need a declaration of
martial domain as soon as possible.

168
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,630
Where is she?

169
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,766
She's unavailable at the moment.

170
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,920
I asked you "where?"

171
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,226
Captain kaido is arriving today.

172
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,726
- He's here.
- He's outside my office. Who is he?

173
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,976
He is a crisis specialist.

174
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,420
He'll be bringing a variety of
personnel to help manage the situation.

175
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,120
We have plenty of security.

176
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,896
What I need now is
some clarity on how exactly

177
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,500
dedra. Calmly.

178
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,920
Let the image of professional
ascendance settle your nerves.

179
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,436
<i>A successful conclusion to this problem</i>

180
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,016
will reinforce the isb's
position at the emperor's side.

181
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,726
You've done excellent
work bringing this forward.

182
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,330
Everyone that matters knows
how well you've played this.

183
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,606
<i>Captain kaido knows the objective.
He will answer to you operationally.</i>

184
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,630
<i>The tactical details, however,
will be at his discretion.</i>

185
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,050
You're aware, sir, that the
insurgents have weapons at this point.

186
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,830
We're counting on it.

187
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,670
Bombing at the naval depot?

188
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,686
I can't even get in there.

189
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,460
It's being investigated.

190
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,516
The rumor is it's a set-up.

191
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,976
They're running it down.

192
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,830
Who? And who's this tactical
guy in your control room?

193
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,260
There's evidence of outside agitators.

194
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,550
You serious?

195
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,040
That's what I came here for.

196
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,306
That is what I've been
trying to do since I got here.

197
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,500
That is what you told me
you wanted, and now...

198
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,420
Now there's evidence I have to beg for?

199
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,186
We are trying to prevent an incident.

200
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,710
By keeping me in the dark.

201
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,186
My sources say this is nonsense.

202
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,686
- Stop.
- What am I doing here?

203
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,920
Syril, please.

204
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,170
You need to go home and pack
and be ready to leave when I tell you.

205
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,896
What?

206
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,550
Good things are waiting for us.

207
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,856
We'll be out of here soon.

208
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,396
We'll be back in
Coruscant. We'll be together.

209
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,920
We'll be rewarded.

210
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,590
For what? What have we accomplished?

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,040
Be careful.

212
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,306
Me?

213
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,790
Do what I told you.

214
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,420
Thank you, kloris.

215
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,620
Are you planning to
go to the office today?

216
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,976
Eventually. It's lovely
out. I'm sure we'll walk.

217
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,516
It's just, they're asking
for schedules this week.

218
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,146
Parking and movement.

219
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,396
Who's asking?

220
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,856
Senate security.

221
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,936
Ridiculous.

222
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,670
I'll speak to them. Thank you.

223
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,856
I'm requesting a new driver.

224
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,380
Don't. They might send someone smart.

225
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,646
We lead from ghorman
again this morning

226
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,646
<i>with reports of another
terrorist attack overnight</i>

227
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,016
<i>as a series of explosions
rocked the naval terminal in palmo.</i>

228
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,686
Perhaps as many as three,

229
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,266
<i>rising over the imperial
naval terminal, where...</i>

230
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,766
With ghorman already under
curfew and increased security,

231
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,556
<i>this represents a turning
point in the terror campaign</i>

232
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,856
<i>that's been escalating for the past year.</i>

233
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,272
Freezing ghorman assets galaxy-wide

234
00:15:39,296 --> 00:15:43,266
<i>and calling for an immediate and
complete blockade of material assistance</i>

235
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,806
<i>until the incident can be fully explained</i>

236
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,540
<i>and the terrorists have
been brought to justice.</i>

237
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,210
Senator mothma.

238
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,250
Apologies. I've been awaiting your arrival.

239
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,210
A word, if you please.

240
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,766
- I'll see you upstairs.
- Okay.

241
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,870
Senator oran.

242
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,647
Any news?

243
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:08,266
Only bad news for the ghormans.

244
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,460
I'm afraid we're near
the point of no return.

245
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,170
How can I help?

246
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,130
Turn back the clock.
Send everyone home.

247
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,960
How I wish I could make that so.

248
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,210
This bombing last night...
They have no shame, do they?

249
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,090
They don't even bother
to lie badly anymore.

250
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,960
I suppose that's the final humiliation.

251
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,306
We're assembling a petition, and
I know how... sad that must sound.

252
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,620
It takes more than failed
legislation to upset me these days.

253
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,660
I came here to thank you, mon.

254
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,830
Your constant courage.

255
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,920
The brave face you put to the world.

256
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,370
I've done a poor job letting you
know how much I admire your grace...

257
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,040
And energy.

258
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,590
Protect yourself.

259
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,040
Seriously?

260
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,130
What?

261
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,080
You could've just asked me.

262
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,976
You would've said no.

263
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,710
- Then what are we doing here?
- What's the harm?

264
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,976
You're lucky maarva is not here.

265
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,806
I'm not the one she'd
be straightening out.

266
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,186
- She hated force healers.
- She hated one force healer,

267
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,306
- 10 years ago.
- One was enough.

268
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,936
Doesn't mean the whole thing's a scam.

269
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,186
They wouldn't be faking
something if it never worked.

270
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,920
Why not? What does that even mean?

271
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,590
You know what I don't understand?

272
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,896
If I was in pain, I'd try to
do everything I could to fix it.

273
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,016
You just run around
pretending like nothing's wrong

274
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,580
and everyone knows it's not true.

275
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,500
What's the risk?

276
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,750
What is this?

277
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,896
- I don't know.
- You set this up.

278
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,590
No. No.

279
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,500
Who are you?

280
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,556
Nobody.

281
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,266
I was just walking
home. We're just leaving.

282
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,000
Can you wait? Please.

283
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,590
Give us a moment. I'll be back.

284
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,460
Sorry.

285
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,146
For what?

286
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,340
I was about to ask how I know you, but.

287
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,027
I'm realizing now that's not it at all.

288
00:20:58,051 --> 00:20:59,500
I'm late already.

289
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,856
I'll see you back there.

290
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,106
He's got a blaster burn that's not healing.

291
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,670
Your right shoulder.

292
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,210
Tell her.

293
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,540
Yes.

294
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
May I?

295
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,580
Thank you.

296
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,016
"Thank you" for what?

297
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,330
The clarity.

298
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,010
That feeling.

299
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,040
It's been a very long time.

300
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,410
I thought it had gone for good.

301
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,870
It's so easy to lose faith.

302
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,420
They come, no matter what.

303
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,370
Sometimes it even works. But this...

304
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,710
You...

305
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,856
All that you've been gathering.

306
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,800
The strength of spirit.

307
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,630
Surely you must feel it.

308
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,260
I'll work on that.

309
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,562
I'll come back and let you know.

310
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:29,870
You saw something.

311
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,476
Why do you keep pushing?

312
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,920
Why are you so upset?

313
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,250
I asked you not to do this.

314
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,090
Stay if you want.

315
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,766
You scared him.

316
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,120
I'm sorry.

317
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,380
It's not easy to do.

318
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,080
Who is he?

319
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,580
A pilot.

320
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,790
A soldier.

321
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,750
Tell me what you saw.

322
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,750
I sense the weight of
things, things I can't see.

323
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,550
Pain, fear...

324
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,290
Need.

325
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,556
Most beings carry the
things that shaped them.

326
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,040
They carry the past.

327
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,130
But some... very few...

328
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,540
Your pilot...

329
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,170
They're gathering as they
go. There's a purpose to it.

330
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,580
He's a messenger.

331
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,170
There's some place he needs to be.

332
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,880
Have you known him long?

333
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,750
I don't remember not knowing him.

334
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Maybe you're the place he needs to be.

335
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,370
Enza.

336
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,340
- Don't you know there's a curfew?
- I needed to see you.

337
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,090
Then have a good look.

338
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,670
I... think there's a way out of
this before things go too far.

339
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:48,000
My people are convinced you're
being coordinated by outside agitators.

340
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,896
If I had something to offer,

341
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,460
if we could lay this
off on outsiders, then...

342
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,920
It's better, isn't it?

343
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,760
That must be confusing.

344
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,670
She asked me who you
were. I said you were a pilot.

345
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,000
Don't tell people what I do.

346
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,210
What happened when she touched you?

347
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,766
She's a cook in the mess hall.

348
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,710
And you're more than a pilot.

349
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,016
It's ridiculous.

350
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,646
She knew you were there.

351
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,016
She felt it from across the
yard. She wasn't making that up.

352
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,106
That wasn't a scam.

353
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,606
- What was it, then?
- I don't know.

354
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,210
I don't even think she knows.

355
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,016
But it happened, and I could sense it,

356
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,540
and I'm not afraid to say that.

357
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,290
I've felt it before, cass.

358
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,562
She called you a messenger.

359
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:23,976
I've had dreams like that.

360
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,356
Why are you doing this?

361
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,670
What if it's important?

362
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,410
I know you felt something.
That's why you're so upset.

363
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,710
Let it in.

364
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,750
It can only be good.
There's no other reason.

365
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,710
What's all this?

366
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,686
We filed an exit plan.

367
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,210
Without a destination.

368
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,606
It's a personal trip.

369
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,880
This ship's to be fitted with
hyper-comms tomorrow.

370
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,420
We'll be back soon.

371
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,226
That is unacceptable, and you know it.

372
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,396
- This isn't a base for privateers.
- All set. Clear.

373
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,960
Those who enjoy the security of
yavin must proclaim their loyalties.

374
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,540
Don't push too hard.

375
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,856
You know where I stand.

376
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,646
The day I need permission
to come and go, I'm gone.

377
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,050
That day is near.

378
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,210
Fall out! Quick time!

379
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,556
Tighten up! Look lively!

380
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,660
Yes, sir.

381
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,260
Fall in!

382
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,410
Form up!

383
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,500
- Sergeant.
- Sir.

384
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,476
Get these men shaped up
and ready for presentation.

385
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,210
There's not a man amongst
them, sir, but I'll do what I can.

386
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,436
Am I gonna have a problem with you?

387
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,500
Duly noted, sir. Problem-free.

388
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,646
What is that supposed to be?

389
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,016
All right, listen in!

390
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,040
He's got a number of
units coming in today.

391
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,830
Attention!

392
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,000
Left turn!

393
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,146
They look like children.

394
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,630
Quick march!

395
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,880
Talk to me.

396
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,870
Twelve hundred at the Mark.

397
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
What are you doing?

398
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,250
- What?
- Look where you're going.

399
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,330
You said come in low, right?

400
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,960
- You okay?
- Yeah.

401
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,806
Hello.

402
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,910
And you.

403
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,106
Haven't seen you in a while.

404
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,210
I know.

405
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,330
Everyone's so busy.

406
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,460
Anything you can talk about?

407
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,540
Well, I'm here now. I'll be around.

408
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,540
I'm doin' intakes.

409
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,960
Scaring the new recruits.

410
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,340
No more smuggling?

411
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,090
I needed a break.

412
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,000
It's good to hear you say that.

413
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,840
I was getting reckless.

414
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,710
You're looking for cassian, aren't you?

415
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,670
No.

416
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,910
They sent me to talk to you.

417
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,670
Draven. Dodonna.

418
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,870
They need him, bix.

419
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,726
They're on the verge of promoting him,

420
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,170
and then he goes and does
something like this morning.

421
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,380
I know you.

422
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,960
I know how deeply you
believe in what we're doing.

423
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,710
We're not luthen's puppets anymore.

424
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,266
We're not a bunch of maniacs
running around aldhani.

425
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,210
We're building a real army.

426
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,800
Cassian is a leader now.

427
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,080
We've all given so much.

428
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,630
A little discipline doesn't
seem too much to ask.

429
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,960
He'll be there when you need him.

430
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,290
I'll pass that along.

431
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,646
When did this happen?

432
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,130
It's been a few months.

433
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,312
I've gotta get going.

434
00:33:33,336 --> 00:33:34,806
What if the comms don't work?

435
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,356
We'll test first thing.

436
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,010
If that's a fail, we'll meet here.

437
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,210
Our secondary would be the ship.

438
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,266
Second floor, third from the left.

439
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,540
She's in there.

440
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,830
She sleeps in the building.

441
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,840
The locals say she's on the
Plaza once or twice a day.

442
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,356
She's easy to spot.

443
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,300
She doesn't stay any place very long.

444
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,670
The glass? It might need two shots.

445
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,516
I don't know.

446
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,540
It's old, but I can ask.

447
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,010
All right, here comes my guy.

448
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,710
Comms, first thing.

449
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,380
Ferrix.

450
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,340
Stone and sky.

451
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,790
Welcome.

452
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,550
Thank you.

453
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,057
Here.

454
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:45,620
You'll have to scan for them.

455
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,460
Ronni goo...

456
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,290
Goo-jah.

457
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,710
- Goo-jah.
- Mid-rim news.

458
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,686
Never heard of it.

459
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,590
We're trying to change that.

460
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,590
I don't see an entry stamp.

461
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,226
Journalists require imperial approval.

462
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,306
I... I know. Yeah. I just got in. I

463
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,910
I didn't wanna risk the... the curfew.

464
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,022
You'll have to go over there
tomorrow and sort it out.

465
00:35:10,046 --> 00:35:11,896
- Yeah.
- We're required to notify them.

466
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,300
Of course. Yeah.

467
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,356
The Alderaan group. Their
shuttle's been canceled.

468
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,550
Again?

469
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,540
Good luck with that.

470
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,436
I have a room at the
front, facing the Plaza.

471
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,840
Perfect.

472
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,067
You know, most guests don't
say that anymore. It can be loud.

473
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:32,620
I'm a deep sleeper.

474
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,590
She will report it.

475
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,890
We turn over our guest
list each afternoon.

476
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,080
Good to know.

477
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,436
And you'll have to carry
your own bag this time.

478
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,630
You know the way.

479
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,290
Thank you.

480
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,840
Is this the weather center?

481
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,170
Clear skies tonight.

482
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,646
<i>We'll be updating the
forecast at first light.</i>

483
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,170
I'll make sure to listen.

484
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,460
We're always here.
