1
00:00:02,958 --> 00:00:05,083
Pre-Mor Enforcement
put out a bulletin last night

2
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:06,916
for someone meeting Cassian's description.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,750
<i>The bulletin
doesn't mention him by name.</i>

4
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:10,666
<i>It says they're looking
for someone from Kenari.</i>

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,333
<i>And or should be considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

6
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,875
<i>He may not appear to be
a formidable opponent,</i>

7
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,500
<i>but two of our men are dead
having made that mistake.</i>

8
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:19,583
Who are you?

9
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:20,833
I know all about you.

10
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:21,916
Yes, I want the box,

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,125
and I'll leave with that
if it's all I can get.

12
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,041
I know you killed two Corpos
at Morlana-One,

13
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,541
and I know they're coming for you.

14
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,458
Seems like such a waste
to let them have you.

15
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,958
Waste of talent.

16
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,333
We have a warrant for Cassian And or.

17
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,000
Brace yourself.

18
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,708
- Let's go!
- There he is!

19
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,416
How many are you?

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,291
- Twelve. Fourteen.
- I swear.

21
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,583
I'd like you to come with me.

22
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,541
Why would I go anywhere with you?

23
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,208
Don't you want to fight
these bastards for real?

24
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,208
There's a medpac.

25
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:11,500
Blue. Bright blue.

26
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,208
The shelf behind you.

27
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,291
Take hold of something.

28
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,083
- Anyone behind us?
- Set for Aldhani.

29
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,708
<i>Calculating for Aldhani.</i>

30
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,833
- Are they coming?
- Do as I say.

31
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,041
<i>Calculations complete.</i>

32
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,666
What's powering this?

33
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,166
I've been in a Fondor Haulcraft.

34
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,583
I've flown them.

35
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,000
Never seen one do that.

36
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,500
Well, it's been a day of surprises
for all of us.

37
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,833
You're bleeding on my floor.

38
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,125
Fix your arm.

39
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:50,833
What's Aldhani?

40
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,541
That depends.

41
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,875
I haven't agreed to do anything
but save my skin.

42
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,125
Yeah, and here you are with your skin.

43
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,333
- What's that?
- Med nog.

44
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:06,875
Just a sip.

45
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,666
Perhaps you got alternatives
I'm not aware of.

46
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,833
Seems to me you have two choices.

47
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,416
Either I drop you somewhere
and you start running

48
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,333
or you come with me
and help with something important.

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,291
And, of course, you could try
and kill me and take the ship.

50
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,875
Define "important."

51
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,416
Taking something of real value
from the Empire.

52
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,541
I don't need you to steal.

53
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,041
Seeing how well you're doing on your own.

54
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,583
I'll take the drop-off.

55
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,833
And do what? Continue as you are?

56
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,500
They'll use the same rope to hang you

57
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,916
whether it's for a plasma coil
or 20 million credits.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,250
I'm offering you everything you want,
all at once.

59
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,875
What is "everything I want"?

60
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,208
Since you know so much about me.

61
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,250
To put a real stick
in the eye of the Empire

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,333
and get paid for it.

63
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,375
I wondered who you were.

64
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,333
Who am I?

65
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,833
Alliance, Sep, guerilla, Partisan Front.

66
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,208
- One of them.
- Isn't it all the same?

67
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,458
It is to me.

68
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,750
So we agree.

69
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,375
No.

70
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,041
I think it's all useless.

71
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,833
Better to spit in their food
and steal their trinkets.

72
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,208
It's better to live.

73
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,291
Better to eat, sleep, do what you want.

74
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,375
You don't know me.

75
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:39,083
I fought in Mimban when I was 16.

76
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,208
Two years of it.

77
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,333
Straight out of prison, into the mud.

78
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,125
I'm one of 50 that survived.

79
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,291
And who did it turn out we were fighting?

80
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,125
Ourselves.

81
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,458
So, please...

82
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,375
You were on the ground
in Mimban for six months.

83
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,750
You came in as a cook.

84
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,500
You lived because you ran.

85
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,208
But you're right about one thing.

86
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,375
The Empire had you fighting each other,

87
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,958
which should make you
hate them all the more,

88
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,583
and you do.

89
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,875
I said I know you.

90
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,833
I know the outside.
I know what people tell me when I ask.

91
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,041
The rest, I imagine.

92
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,125
I imagine your hate.

93
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,833
I imagine that no matter
what you tell me or tell yourself,

94
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,625
you'll ultimately die
fighting these bastards.

95
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,916
So what I'm asking is this.

96
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:40,541
Wouldn't you rather give it all at once
to something real

97
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,916
than carve off useless pieces
till there's nothing left?

98
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,916
I didn't risk my ass
for the Star path unit.

99
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,041
I came for you.

100
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,708
What's the offer?

101
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,958
Five days.

102
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,625
Big stakes, big danger.

103
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,916
Prepped team, good plan.

104
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:07,583
You survive and deliver,
I'll give you 200,000.

105
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,750
What would we be stealing?

106
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,041
The quarterly payroll
for an entire Imperial sector.

107
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,708
With the next quarter's
detention estimates

108
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,916
expected to increase
across the Ryloth sector,

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,833
any further erosion in local authority

110
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,291
may require an increase
in our black line budget.

111
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,666
And where would you target
these new resources, Supervisor Grandi?

112
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,250
Uh, increase surveillance, sir.

113
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,375
Looking for what?

114
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,333
Anti-Imperial activity as always.

115
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,250
Uh, are you being
intentionally vague?

116
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:22,958
No, sir.

117
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,666
I'll expect specifics
by the end of the day. Lagret,

118
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,208
what is this item from Arval a-Six?

119
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,833
A positive development, sir.

120
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,541
The dimensions of the conflict
have diminished sufficiently

121
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,875
that mining has resumed
on the occupied lands.

122
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,625
Storage issues
with the displaced?

123
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,708
Ongoing.

124
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,833
As is your unfinished memorandum
of recommendations regarding the problem.

125
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:44,833
My staff is awaiting an assessment
from Arval a-Six's ministerial director.

126
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,958
Because they've done
such an excellent job so far, hmm?

127
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,708
- What do we do here?
- Sir?

128
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,541
What is our purpose, Lagret?

129
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,708
On Arval a-Six?

130
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,416
I open the question to the room.

131
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,750
What do we do in this building?
Why are we here? Anyone?

132
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,000
We're here to further security objectives
by collecting intelligence,

133
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:08,291
providing useful analysis, and conducting
effective covert action, sir.

134
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,625
Very good, Dedra.

135
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:13,708
That is verbatim
from the ISB mission statement, and wrong.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,625
Security is an illusion.

137
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,250
You want security? Call the Navy.

138
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,916
Launch a regiment of troopers.

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,750
We are healthcare providers.

140
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:23,916
We treat sickness.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,583
We identify symptoms.

142
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:30,541
We locate germs whether they arise
from within or have come from the outside.

143
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:34,958
The longer we wait to identify a disorder,
the harder it is to treat the disease.

144
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,916
- Do you understand my meaning, Lagret?
- Yes, sir.

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't trouble yourself
writing the memorandum.

146
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,125
I'll reassign it.

147
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,458
Blevin, Morlana sector.
This incident on Ferrix.

148
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,333
Corporate Security, sir.
They're still in charge out there.

149
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,333
They tried to serve a warrant and ran into
more trouble than they'd anticipated.

150
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,500
Trouble meaning what?

151
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,291
Several dead. Property damage.

152
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,791
Interruption of service.

153
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,125
A stolen Imperial Star path unit
was recovered at the scene.

154
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,083
- Those responsible?
- Unknown, sir.

155
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,916
- I'm heading out after this meeting.
- We'll speak before you leave.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,458
- Jung.
- Sir?

157
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,208
Elaborate on these
added protection requests

158
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,166
for traffic to the Abrion sector.

159
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,875
Proactive measure, sir.

160
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,291
There's an increase in construction
shipments going to Scarif, sir.

161
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,000
Think of a name.

162
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,083
Think of a name for yourself.

163
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,791
Clem.

164
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,833
For the next five days, you'll be Clem.

165
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,541
Who's that?

166
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,333
You'll be working for her.

167
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,625
I thought you were in charge.

168
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,791
I never said that.

169
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,500
She's gonna hate this idea to start.

170
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,916
She's gonna argue with me.

171
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:20,208
Think it's best you stay inside
until I've had time to work it all out.

172
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,166
Take this.

173
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,250
What is it?

174
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,541
It's a down payment.

175
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,875
It's a Kuati Signet.

176
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,666
Blue kyber. Sky stone.

177
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,041
The ancient world.

178
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,541
Celebrates the uprising
against the Rakatan invaders.

179
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,375
Don't take less than 50,000 for it.

180
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,541
Just know
it will always be worth more to me.

181
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,291
I want it back when this is over.

182
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,500
If I live.

183
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,958
I want it back.

184
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,916
- Against 200,000.
- Giving you my word.

185
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,791
- Hello, Vel.
- We almost didn't get the message.

186
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:32,916
I'm glad you made it.

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,041
They've started patrolling
the old Stone Valley.

188
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,750
It's a full day gettin' out here now.

189
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,000
I like hearing that. The vigilance.

190
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,500
I count on your discipline.

191
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,916
Obviously something's wrong.

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,375
No. Actually,
I think things are coming together.

193
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,333
<i>Something I can help you with?</i>

194
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:14,875
He can pilot. He can shoot. He can lie.
He speaks Alarin, Myo, Nari.

195
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,000
He's got steady nerves
and isn't afraid to kill.

196
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,625
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- He can pilot.

197
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,166
We go in three days!

198
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,833
He increases your chances
of success dramatically.

199
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,458
Now? Like this?

200
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,625
Five months in?

201
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,083
Just plug in some new person?

202
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,416
It'll tear the team apart.

203
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,666
Well, then it's not much of a team, is it?

204
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:38,166
You're vulnerable and you know it.
I'm buying you critical redundancy.

205
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,708
What do you mean "buying"?

206
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,125
I'm paying him.

207
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,416
No.

208
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,833
Two hundred thousand.

209
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,083
We've been eating roots
and sleeping on rocks for this rebellion

210
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,458
and now you've got
a mercenary on board?

211
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,375
You're wasting energy. You know I'm right.

212
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,625
We need this to work, Vel.

213
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,041
Failure would be devastating.

214
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,458
What would I tell the others?

215
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,000
You'll tell them
it was always a part of the plan.

216
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,791
Are you giving me a choice here?

217
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,166
Yeah.

218
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,875
You take him or call it off.

219
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,458
I was planning to shut you down.

220
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,416
Your odds have improved
since we set the meeting.

221
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,500
You'll take him in
and lie about how it's come to pass.

222
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,958
You'll plug him in as a replacement
for anyone who goes down along the way.

223
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,875
In the next three days,
if for any reason... Look at me!

224
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,083
You wanted to lead?

225
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,125
This is what it comes to.

226
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,708
You got three days.

227
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,791
Something feels off,
something turns, someone starts to fold,

228
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,833
you step up, you lead,
you cancel the mission.

229
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,500
I need to know you understand.

230
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,833
And if he's the problem?

231
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,041
Well, that's the advantage of renting him.

232
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,000
He's disposable.

233
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,916
This has to be a win, Vel.

234
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Yes.

235
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,666
Yes.

236
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,375
Clem!

237
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,458
You will immediately relinquish

238
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,958
any and all com links,
weapons, and scandocs.

239
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,333
You will not return
to your living quarters.

240
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:35,166
You will leave here and be escorted
with haste to the transfer center,

241
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,750
where you'll be issued
with any personal items

242
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,958
that the Imperial inspectors
have had time to inventory.

243
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,666
You will holo-certify
receipt of said items.

244
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,875
You will holo-certify confirmation
of the official ISB After Action Report

245
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,416
detailing your involvement
and culpability in said Ferrix incident.

246
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
- Question, sir.
- No.

247
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:59,416
And no, you will not waste
further Imperial time reading the reports.

248
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,458
But I've had nothing to do with this.

249
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,708
Well, exactly.

250
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,166
It took the combined ingredients

251
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,083
of idiocy, ineptitude,
and total disengagement

252
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:17,083
for this farce to have reached
the full apex of incredulous disaster.

253
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,750
Seriously?

254
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,833
My files are filled
with Corporate Security fiascos,

255
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,625
but this takes the prize.

256
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,625
And you, Deputy Inspector Karn.

257
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,541
Proud, are we?

258
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,916
Take solace in this.

259
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,125
You will not be replaced.

260
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,875
You've rung the final bell
on Corporate independence.

261
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:47,708
As of this morning, the Morlana system
is under permanent Imperial authority.

262
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,083
Congratulations on that.

263
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,416
Is your arm
something I need to worry about?

264
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,541
No.

265
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,291
Well, it's a long walk,
through the night.

266
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,625
Who is he?

267
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,750
You should've asked him that
when you had the chance.

268
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:24,333
He told me you were the boss
and you wouldn't like my being here.

269
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,875
That's about all I know.

270
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,750
He is something we will never discuss.

271
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,458
When we get to camp,
we're going to tell them

272
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,125
this was my idea
and we've been planning it all the while.

273
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,708
We never mention him.

274
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:41,125
If you change that in any way,
you and I are going to have a big problem.

275
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,333
And why so far?

276
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,708
We're robbing the armory
at the Aldhani Garrison.

277
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,500
There's an Imperial airfield nearby,

278
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,541
and they've got nothing better to do
than patrol.

279
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,375
So, this is the safe route.

280
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,875
He told me about the payroll,
not the garrison!

281
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,875
I don't know who you're talking about.

282
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,166
You're taking on an Imperial armory?

283
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,458
Are you not joining us?

284
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,375
Us? How many of us are there?

285
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,833
Now we are seven.

286
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,375
Seven?
Seven against a garrison?

287
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,166
Save your wind. This is a long walk.

288
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,625
Hey, hold on. Hold on.

289
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,083
Get down! Tuck in!

290
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,958
They won't be back today.

291
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:34,708
Come on.

292
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,166
This says five dead.

293
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,000
One local
and four Pre-Mor security employees.

294
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,125
Uh, they've misspelt Ferrix.

295
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,833
Where is my Star path unit?

296
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,041
Where are you?

297
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,375
He said it in the meeting.
It's got to be here.

298
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,750
There's a raw transmission
in here somewhere.

299
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,708
Hang on.

300
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:05,375
"Varnisi. Unauthorized Imperial equipment,
Ferrix, 0430.

301
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:11,166
"Ensign retrieved a sealed Imperial
NS-9 Star path unit from the site."

302
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,208
That is our box from Steergard.

303
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,416
Has to be.

304
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,041
Right, that gives us jurisdiction.

305
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,458
I want you to go to Blevin's office,

306
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,500
tell them we need
everything they've got on Ferrix.

307
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,166
It might mean more if you went.

308
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,083
I don't want to spark his interest.

309
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,916
<i>Orbiting Coruscant.</i>

310
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,208
Your controls.

311
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,500
Landing protocol 037.

312
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,333
<i>Protocol 037.</i>

313
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,916
What is this place?

314
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,000
Nothing special.

315
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,208
There used to be hundreds
of settlements up here.

316
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,333
Forty thousand Aldhanis
all across the highlands.

317
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,000
They were here for centuries,

318
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,208
but it only took the Empire
a decade to clear them out.

319
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,333
- Killed them?
- No.

320
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,208
Drove them south.

321
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,375
There's an Enterprise Zone
in the Lowlands.

322
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,666
Factories, new towns, Imperial housing.

323
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,583
Aldhani has the unfortunate quality
of being close to nothing

324
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,625
and not very far away from everything.

325
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,791
It's the perfect hub for distribution.

326
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,041
If one were trying
to take over the galaxy.

327
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,958
So, who are we supposed to be?

328
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,083
There's still
a few shepherds in the hills.

329
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:32,416
Nature lovers, mystics, dead-enders.

330
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,166
Drink up. We've a way to go.

331
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,041
My assistant tells me

332
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,291
you refused to turn over the file
on this incident in Ferrix.

333
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,791
I have work to do.

334
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,958
That was an official request
made by an officer of my staff.

335
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,875
I suggest you schedule an appointment.

336
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,833
I want the full Ferrix report.

337
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,125
It's my sector.

338
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,125
An Imperial Star path unit was stolen
from the Steergard Naval Yard

339
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,166
and found at the scene.
That gives me jurisdictional access.

340
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,125
You've been here, what, just over a year?

341
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,750
You might want to steady the ladder
before you start climbing.

342
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,833
I'm not looking for career advice.

343
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,833
You fall here, you fall alone.

344
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,458
Are you denying my request?

345
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,375
For the second time today.

346
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,333
Fine. I'll take it to Major Partagaz.

347
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,375
Don't look down.

348
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,875
Everyone's dead.

349
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,708
While you were sleeping,
they came in, slit everybody's throat.

350
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,416
You ride with Mossy, Garvish?

351
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,583
Saw Gerrera?

352
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:14,125
Fall asleep on watch, they're gonna put
your head on a pike for a laugh.

353
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,500
Sorry.

354
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,666
Don't tell Vel.

355
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,791
I won't.

356
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,083
You will.

357
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,750
You better think what you're gonna say
'cause she's coming down now.

358
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:28,500
Actually...

359
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,541
...there's two.

360
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,625
What do you make of that?

361
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,958
We better make sure
they know what's comin'.

362
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,708
Who is it?

363
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,500
That's what I was gonna ask you.

364
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:08,958
What's she doing?

365
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:35,916
Gather up.

366
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,666
This is Clem.

367
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,333
Haven't mentioned him before now

368
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,875
because I wasn't sure
we could get him here on time.

369
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,166
We've had a stroke of luck.

370
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,666
He's been able to fight his way free.

371
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,333
He'll give us critical redundancy
in all areas.

372
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,375
It's a bit late for surprises.

373
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,375
That's Skeen.

374
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,333
This is Taramyn.

375
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,250
Nemik.

376
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,791
And Cinta.

377
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,250
We've always known we were short a man.

378
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,583
Can I speak with you?

379
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,250
Let's get Clem settled in.

380
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,583
Good to have you, Clem.

381
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,500
We'll take all the help we can get.

382
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:19,708
Cinta, feed him
and then take a look at his arm.

383
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,375
- Vel.
- The posts on the corral are down again.

384
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,958
Now, unless you two want to be
chasin' animals all day,

385
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,166
I'd get out there now. Okay?

386
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,250
Let's get to it.

387
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,208
We'll work Clem into the program at drill.

388
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:45,458
<i>Telgordo Travel service to Hosnian Prime,</i>

389
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:48,291
<i>Plexis, and Eufornis Major</i>

390
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:53,875
<i>will now be departing
from platforms 7-12 and 7-13.</i>

391
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,791
<i>Do not join the line
without your boarding pass.</i>

392
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,375
Mother.

393
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,291
What are you starin' at?

394
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,083
Blaster burn.

395
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,541
Needs to be cleaned.

396
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,333
Apologies in advance.

397
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,166
We're trying to save our pain meds.

398
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,458
- How do you know him?
- He comes highly recommended.

399
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:11,583
- So you don't know him.
- I know that we need him.

400
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:14,333
That's all I'll say.
Anything else is a violation of security.

401
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,750
No, he's got brass.
You... You can feel it.

402
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,541
And we can use a hand,
but this late in the game?

403
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,875
- As opposed to when?
- You trust him with our lives?

404
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,125
That's my call to make.

405
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,833
He's committed.

406
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,041
I'm feeling that.

407
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:28,916
I want to.

408
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,125
Feel what?

409
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:31,541
His belief in the cause.

410
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:35,041
When it comes down to it,
that's all I need to know.

411
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Vel.

412
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,208
- Vel!
- I trust him.

413
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:44,375
Okay?

414
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,208
All right?

415
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:04,166
Senator Mon Mothma's here.

416
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:07,666
New driver.

417
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,000
Anyone we know?

418
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:11,750
Never seen him.

419
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,125
Chandrilan?

420
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,958
One would think.

421
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:21,625
Senator.

422
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:24,500
- What a pleasure to see you.
- You as well, Luthen.

423
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:27,125
Sorry to be so late.
It's always right when you're leaving,

424
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:30,125
everyone remembers things
they're meant to bother you with.

425
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,500
Free your mind, Senator.
This is a place where time stands still.

426
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:35,750
It's hard being surrounded
with this much history

427
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:39,083
and not be humbled by the insignificance
of our daily anxieties.

428
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:41,666
How true.
And how I need to hear that.

429
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,416
- You know Kleya.
- Of course.

430
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,958
We often refer to the gallery

431
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:47,250
as Coruscant's unofficial
temple of patience.

432
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,541
Well, I have to start
coming here more often.

433
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:50,958
You're teasing us.

434
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,333
So, a gift for your husband.

435
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:56,583
Yes. It's his Day of Days.
It's a Chandrilan custom.

436
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:57,666
One of our many.

437
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,958
Yours is a rich history.

438
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,000
Well, that's a kind way of putting it.

439
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:02,708
I put aside a few things.

440
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:06,375
If I recall,
he has an interest in military artifacts.

441
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:07,458
Yes.

442
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:09,166
So,
let's start with the oldest one.

443
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,541
It's a Utapaun monk cudgel.

444
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,041
You see the ceremonial variety
in many places,

445
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,375
but this is the real thing.

446
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,250
It's a unique gift for most, but...

447
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,958
it's a treasure for the true aficionado.

448
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,375
Dated to the eighth archaic settlem...

449
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,708
May I show you something?

450
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:28,333
Oh, don't bother.
I couldn't afford anything here.

451
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:30,750
Please. There's no harm in looking.

452
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,166
We just got in
some terribly interesting coins.

453
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:35,958
Yeah.

454
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:41,333
I'm trying to expand Perrin's tastes
beyond fighting implements.

455
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:43,375
Is there anything else
that might interest him?

456
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:44,625
Well, your timing is excellent.

457
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:47,250
I have something very special
that just came in.

458
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,333
Come with me.

459
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,458
It's a two-faced divinity.

460
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,458
Fourteen thousand years old.

461
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:58,583
A sun goddess and a serpent
from the over world

462
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:01,125
sharing the same mouth.

463
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,416
If you can't deliver,
I need to know.

464
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,833
- Do you think I'm not trying?
- I never think that.

465
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:08,416
But I need to start planning
if you're no longer coming through.

466
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,541
The money's there.

467
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,916
It's just getting very dangerous
to move it around.

468
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,625
I can't pull funds the way I used to.

469
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:16,958
- They're watching me now.
- Oh, they're watching everyone.

470
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:18,958
This is different. They're everywhere.

471
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:21,500
There's a new spy every day at the Senate.

472
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,791
I visit the bank, they're all new faces.

473
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:26,166
You got a new driver.

474
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,125
I feel under siege.

475
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:33,291
I have many mouths to feed.

476
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,041
I can only forage for so long.

477
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,625
I found someone I think can help me.

478
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:41,708
Someone who?

479
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,916
To bring into the circle? No.

480
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,625
- I know what I'm asking.
- No.

481
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:46,791
We're vulnerable enough.

482
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,625
We need funding, not more people.

483
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:50,875
Don't lecture me on vulnerability.

484
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:52,500
No one's more at risk than I am.

485
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:54,708
You think I haven't thought this through?

486
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,708
I'd be the first one to fall.

487
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:07,416
Why don't you take this on loan?

488
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,291
May I?

489
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:12,291
If your husband doesn't love it,
I'll be glad to take it back.

490
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:15,250
It's a daring choice,

491
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,666
but I trust you'll have the courage
to turn back

492
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,333
if it should be a bit much.

493
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,416
I appreciate that.

494
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,333
You'll be here?

495
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,666
Well, if not, Kleya can always reach me.

496
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,125
Kleya, can we have this wrapped
for the Senator?

497
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,750
He's with us.

498
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:31,000
Stay.

499
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:32,625
No, I didn't.

500
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,083
What the hell is going on?

501
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,291
When did this happen?

502
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,041
What, he's here now? Where?

503
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,458
- Getting cleaned up.
- And we've no say in this?

504
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,208
- It's not a vote.
- Just like that?

505
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,541
It's been in the works.

506
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,833
- What else don't I know about?
- This helps us.

507
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,750
You were cutting it close.
You said it yourself.

508
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,875
Three days out.

509
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:52,166
What were you gonna do
if I couldn't get here today?

510
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,875
Turn up with an extra face to explain?

511
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:55,291
I knew you'd come through.

512
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,208
We're not prepped for this.

513
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,208
We don't even have enough comms as it is.

514
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:01,250
- We have two spares.
- That was our backup.

515
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,916
Clem is our backup.

516
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:05,208
We have an extra uniform.

517
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,125
Gonna need to leave us
your belt and gloves.

518
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:09,208
Clem.

519
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:13,666
We need another hand, and you know it.

520
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,583
I should've been consulted.

521
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,583
On that, we agree.

522
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:21,291
Clem, this is Lieutenant Gorn.

523
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,583
- He's our contact at the garrison.
- Wounded on top of it.

524
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:26,791
On top of what?

525
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:30,166
Being someone I've never met
who's suddenly got my neck in their hands.

526
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,291
I know the feeling.

527
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,625
- Are we done?
- Who is he?

528
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:34,666
He's Clem.
He's here, that's all that matters.

529
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,166
Look, we're wasting daylight.
Let's get on with it.

530
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,541
Give Nemik a hand.

531
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,208
What's with all the patrols
on Stone Canyon?

532
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,458
There's an Imperial engineer
arriving from Coruscant.

533
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:52,291
We're mapping the old trail for him.
But that'll stop tomorrow.

534
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,500
I'm pushing all our attention
toward the Lowlands.

535
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:56,208
How long do we have you?

536
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:57,833
I've got a midnight inspection.

537
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:58,916
Let's get going.

538
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:32,750
What's all this?

539
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,291
- Dinner for the governor.
- What governor?

540
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,583
The governor of Hanna.

541
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:39,916
My regimental mate, that governor.

542
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,333
That's tonight?

543
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,708
It's on your calendar.

544
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,125
I added it a month ago
after we discussed it.

545
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,333
You don't remember?

546
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:50,125
I remember you wearing me down.

547
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,125
I didn't think anyone could do that.

548
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:54,833
Are you enjoying this?

549
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:57,166
No. Just looking forward
to seeing some old friends.

550
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,500
Oh, who else is coming?

551
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:00,000
Seating chart's just there.

552
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:07,166
Ars Dangor? Sly Moore?
From the Vizier's private chamber?

553
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,416
Is that a problem?

554
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,000
You can't be serious.
These people hate me.

555
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:12,375
They spend every day
trying to undo anything I've touched.

556
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,625
Well, perhaps tomorrow
they'll think twice.

557
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:16,708
Uh, not right now, please.

558
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:17,833
Go!

559
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:24,208
You shouldn't have invited them
without making sure I was aware.

560
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,125
Well, it's a bit late to cancel.

561
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,625
But at your pleasure.

562
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,666
Well played, Perrin.

563
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,458
And no, I'm not being serious.

564
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:38,291
Don't seat them near me.

565
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:39,416
Oh, I've taken care of that.

566
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,000
You're at the boring end of the table.
These people are fun.

567
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,666
Oh, are they? Are they fun?

568
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,791
We should find
some Ghorman guests for tonight

569
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,333
and see how amused they are.

570
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:50,500
Your fun friends just cut off
their shipping lanes yesterday.

571
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,333
Do you know how many will starve?

572
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,708
Oh, perhaps we can laugh about it
over the third course.

573
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:57,208
Perhaps you should have a rest.

574
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:59,041
If you make me pay attention, I will.

575
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,291
And you won't be happy.

576
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,083
Don't do this again.

577
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:07,458
There's rumor
you bought me a present.

578
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:08,875
It's going back.

579
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:12,125
Must everything be boring and sad?

580
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:17,750
Akti Amaugh, the Valley of Caves.

581
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:18,916
The sacred valley.

582
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,833
The Empire came in 13 years ago

583
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:24,583
and liberated the air base, Alkenzi,
50 klicks west of here.

584
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:28,375
They quickly discovered the unique
storage possibilities of the caverns,

585
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:30,208
claimed the land for the Emperor,

586
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:33,458
and dammed up Nasma Klain,
the sacred river.

587
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:38,166
Now, the Aldhani Garrison
is a depot for supplies, weapons,

588
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,916
and the payroll
for the entire Imperial sector.

589
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:44,916
Garrison, observation tower,
sentry defenses,

590
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,041
all to protect this runway opening here.

591
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:49,791
I'll do it. It's fragile, that piece.
The rain gets into the glue.

592
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,083
The runway descends
underground to the flight deck

593
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,583
of a single Max-7 Rono freighter.

594
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:56,166
Vel said you could pilot.

595
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,291
Fly a Rono?

596
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,000
A box freighter?

597
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,583
Mmm, it's not really flying, but yeah.

598
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:04,458
This room behind the flight deck,
that's a vault.

599
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,416
We're taking crates of payroll
from that room,

600
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,416
loading the freighter,
and escaping out of the runway tunnel.

601
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,791
- Obviously, it's not to scale.
- Escaping?

602
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,416
- In a Rono?
- Yeah.

603
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,000
Those were TIE fighters
we saw on the way in.

604
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:19,666
- How far is the air base?
- From the garrison...

605
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,541
- Fifty klicks, you said.
- Fifty-two.

606
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:22,708
Fine, 52.

607
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:24,583
They'll be on you in minutes.

608
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,916
Nine minutes. We've timed it.

609
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,500
- Mmm.
- Okay.

610
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,625
You'll be lucky to make the horizon.

611
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,166
It's a suicide run.

612
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,375
Exactly.

613
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:37,333
That's why they only keep
a 40-man regiment in the garrison.

614
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:39,750
Because they know
no one's stupid enough to try it.

615
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:41,000
No one but us.

616
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:46,875
These old stones, Nasma Brani,

617
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:51,041
it's a temple or what's left of it
that once sat on the mighty river.

618
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:53,916
Lieutenant Gorn, you tell it.

619
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:56,416
Once every three years

620
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,375
for as long as anyone can remember,

621
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,916
the Aldhanis gather in this valley
for a celestial event

622
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,125
they call <i>Mak-ani bray Dhani.</i>

623
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,250
The Eye of Aldhani. Thousands of them.

624
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:11,375
They'd hike for weeks to get here
just to see it from the sacred land.

625
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:15,125
- To see what?
- Imagine 50 meteor showers all at once,

626
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:18,166
but like a curtain
being pulled across the sky

627
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,833
until the Eye, the window to the galaxy,
forms over the horizon.

628
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:24,166
You've seen this?

629
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,208
I've been here almost seven years.
I've seen it twice.

630
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:30,500
It's not the event it used to be.

631
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:33,500
Now they've got everyone relocated,
it's a pretty sad affair,

632
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,541
but the Eye,

633
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:38,583
it's not something you'll soon forget.

634
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:40,125
Once every three years.

635
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:43,375
To a thousandth of a second.
And it's not really a meteor shower.

636
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:46,666
It's a recurrent band of crystalized,
noctilucent microdensities.

637
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,750
Billions of crystals.
Very heavy but small and unstable.

638
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:51,458
As the planet passes through the belt,

639
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:53,833
they swarm the atmosphere,
heat up, and explode.

640
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,291
From the ground, it's a thing of beauty.

641
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,541
In the sky, it's chaos.

642
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:01,291
We've calculated an escape trajectory

643
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:03,666
that gets us out
just before the Eye closes.

644
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,916
This happens in three days' time.

645
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,250
That's your cover.

646
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:14,958
Yes.

647
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,541
Gets us in, gets us out.

648
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:19,333
They won't know where we came from,
and if we can beat the clock,

649
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:21,708
we'll be gone
before they even know what happened.

650
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:24,458
Now, you've got a lot to learn
and very little time to do it,

651
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:28,625
so what we need to know is,
are you in all the way?

652
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:34,208
Let's get to it.

653
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,083
Speak.

654
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:41,833
She's demanding the raw data
from the incident on Ferrix.

655
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:43,833
The Star path unit
that was recovered at the scene

656
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:46,791
has been traced to a theft
at an air base under my jurisdiction, sir.

657
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:50,041
She's overreaching
to increase the size of her portfolio.

658
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,583
She should spend more time
on the security at her bases

659
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:55,416
- and less furthering her career.
- Lieutenant Meero.

660
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,541
The stolen item has great value,
sir, particularly to the rebels.

661
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:01,166
Tracing its theft
might expose activity in my sector.

662
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,250
People also take things for money,
do they not?

663
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,875
Is it worth creating
this much intra-office friction

664
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:09,125
in the pursuit of what seems like
a case of a robbery gone awry?

665
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:12,291
Sir, it is my feeling
that this is part of an ongoing effort

666
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:16,041
to steal proprietary Imperial equipment
in anticipation of an organized rebellion.

667
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:18,291
I have three
previous case files on my desk

668
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:19,791
that begin to suggest a pattern.

669
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,125
Your feeling.

670
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:25,125
I'm seeing signs of coordinated activity
over a number of sectors.

671
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:26,500
What activity?

672
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:28,750
Similar items of interest,
repeated methods.

673
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:31,750
- Gut instinct.
- You came to us from enforcement.

674
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:32,833
Yes, sir.

675
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:36,541
Here, we act on vetted
and verified information.

676
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:41,083
Alert me when this materializes
into something more definite.

677
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:43,875
Until then,
confine future activities to your sectors.

678
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,125
Thank you, Lieutenant.

679
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:55,083
You have two sectors to supervise.
Blevin is handling six.

680
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:56,958
He does, I will admit,

681
00:40:57,041 --> 00:41:00,333
hew to the traditional viewpoint
of this office and its staffing.

682
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,166
He is, I'm sure, a challenge to work with.

683
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,416
His quarterly reports, however, are in
and yours are not,

684
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,458
and here we are spending
your valuable time with this issue.

685
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:13,708
There's a high bar
for your performance, Lieutenant.

686
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:16,083
Unfair perhaps,

687
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:18,250
but senseless to ignore

688
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:21,541
and potentially the foundation
of a uniquely superior career.

689
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,583
You're supposed to be
more competent and tucked away.

690
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:26,833
That's why you're here.

691
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,291
That's why we're bringing in
officers like you.

692
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:35,625
Let's remind everyone of that
and not get lost in the dust.

693
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:37,000
Yes, sir.

694
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:40,833
On a positive note, I was impressed
with your detention numbers from Sev Tok.

695
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:42,208
Far above the quota.

696
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:45,250
I may be sending more
of that sort of work your way.

697
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:46,791
- Thank you, sir.
- We're done.

698
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,416
Know how to use this?

699
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:20,208
Yeah.

700
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:22,958
That's the Rono freighter specs
and the console layout.

701
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,041
You get done with that,

702
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,083
that's a detailed map of the garrison.

703
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,000
That's an Aldhani phrase book.

704
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:43,458
Can I eat my food?

705
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:48,375
You'll eat,
you'll let Cinta check the bandage,

706
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:51,125
and you'll have learned all that
by morning.

707
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,416
I'll take the first watch.
