1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,346
It's that time of the year, toffi!

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,846
Senate investiture. I
absolutely adore this holiday.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,846
I want to talk parties.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,386
I wanna know who's
going where with who.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,266
I wanna know where you've been invited.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,016
Dedra meero is running ghorman.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,386
She's been on it all year.
All this time. Hiding it.

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,846
What's the obsession with ghorman?

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,346
- What are they after?
- I don't know.

10
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,476
I'm trying to rethink this all with her
in the picture. It doesn't make sense.

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,976
I need an assessment. Carro rylanz.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,726
He's running the ghorman
front. I'm not sure about the group.

13
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,806
And bix?

14
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,160
No. You'd have to go alone.

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,766
I'm not loving Coruscant.

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,636
It's overwhelming. I know you...

17
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,790
You've been struggling.

18
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,870
- No! No! No!
- Hey.

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,500
We need you, bix. We need you healthy.

20
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,056
No word from your friend?

21
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,136
Cinta? No.

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,016
Luthen knows but he won't tell me.

23
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,346
That's not acceptable.

24
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,386
If she wanted to see me, she would.

25
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,596
I'm only meeting you
because we find ourselves

26
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,790
with a unique opportunity.

27
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,556
We have a source inside.

28
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,830
- An imperial source?
- I'll not say.

29
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,910
Feeding false
information is what they do.

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,556
They're pretty good at it.

31
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,306
The information is reliable.

32
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,016
They'll need help, sir.

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,386
How may we assist?

34
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,676
Transport schedules
need to remain consistent.

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,226
The information I pass
them needs to be accurate.

36
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,386
Done.

37
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,200
Let it continue? Let them
build what they want?

38
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,330
Is that truly your recommendation?

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,976
I have more questions
than recommendations.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,410
Not much of a revolutionary, are you?

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,540
It's a forgery.

42
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,636
What else have we missed?

43
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,806
Even the finest collections
have problems now and then.

44
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,976
"Let's put a bug in davo sculdun's
office that leads directly back to us."

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,516
You agreed to it!

46
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,790
We're drowning.

47
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,540
And you keep pretending
it's all under control.

48
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,790
We have to take it out at the party.

49
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,620
And if we can't?

50
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,950
We should be prepared.

51
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,096
- You're late.
- Yeah.

52
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,450
We had a spot inspection
coming out of ghorman.

53
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,870
Preflight check complete.

54
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,476
Hold on.

55
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,200
Set for Coruscant.

56
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,290
Calculating for Coruscant.

57
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,370
Calculation complete.

58
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,290
Look at you.

59
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,370
What's his name?

60
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,580
Varian Skye.

61
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,580
Not bad.

62
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,806
Tell me about the ghorman
front. You weren't there very long.

63
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,290
Don't get involved.

64
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,290
That's your assessment? Just like that.

65
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,000
Two days in. You barely looked around.

66
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,250
How do you know what I did?

67
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,886
We heard it didn't go very well.

68
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,096
You heard? Really? I
only left this morning.

69
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,040
Well, they sent word. They're
very prompt, the ghormans.

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,700
What they are is impatient.

71
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,830
They started too late.
Now they're rushing.

72
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,346
That's awfully definitive.

73
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,870
They're not ready, luthen.

74
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,910
I think they know that.

75
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,910
That's why we sent you.

76
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,806
The empire is building an
armory in the center of town.

77
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,096
They say it's a new complex
office, but everyone knows the truth.

78
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,016
There's nothing to be done about it now,

79
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,056
and the more trouble they
make, the worse it will be.

80
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,516
- There's always something to be done.
- Yeah?

81
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,540
Yeah? They have a plan.

82
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,846
They want to hijack an imperial transport

83
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,676
to prove something that
everybody already knows is true.

84
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,846
Who's gonna care about it?

85
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,636
The empire will care about it.

86
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,790
Exactly.

87
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,266
In a place where they know nothing
about fighting. They'll be crushed.

88
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:58,160
They're finally wanting to do
something and you tell them to be careful.

89
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,250
It doesn't matter to you, does it?

90
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,290
It doesn't matter? Ghorman in play?

91
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,500
A new front line against the empire?

92
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,266
The chance for that? That's a triumph.

93
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,346
You're thinking small.
You're thinking like a thief.

94
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,846
I'm thinking like a soldier.

95
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,370
Think like a leader.

96
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,976
Think about a planet
like ghorman in rebellion.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,330
A planet of wealth and status.

98
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,160
And... if it goes up in flames?

99
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,040
It will burn... very brightly.

100
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,540
I'll skip this one.

101
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,950
Will you excuse me a moment?

102
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,266
Yes?

103
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,540
Waste of time. This
piece isn't what we need.

104
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,346
We knew that already.

105
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,330
I thought seeing it in person
would make a difference.

106
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,120
I have a customer waiting.

107
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,330
You were sourcing another item.

108
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,790
It's being delivered as we speak.

109
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,200
Visiting friends?

110
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,200
- Why do you ask?
- I'm curious by nature.

111
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,160
I have friends everywhere.

112
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,120
I had a feeling you were on your way.

113
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,040
Hi.

114
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,950
Look at this place.

115
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,830
You cleaned it up.

116
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,080
We're here. Might as well.

117
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,556
Yeah. The flowers...

118
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,950
They're expensive. But they are beautiful.

119
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,200
The trip? Okay?

120
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,136
Different.

121
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,250
Who were you?

122
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,540
I was varian Skye.

123
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,580
I was a fashion designer.

124
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,950
Yeah.

125
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,290
I was very, very pretty.

126
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,330
I'm sorry I missed that.

127
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,080
Fresh blue suit.

128
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,346
Coruscanti shirt.

129
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,500
Polished shoes.

130
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,790
Just your kinda guy.

131
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,556
Well, you're gonna have to
bring him home some night.

132
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,176
You... you must be hungry.

133
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Hey.

134
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,120
You okay?

135
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,660
Was it dangerous?

136
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,830
Ghorman? No.

137
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,830
Just... all talk. A waste of time.

138
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,306
It's luthen that scared me.

139
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,580
Yeah. Tell me about it.

140
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,306
He came after you left.

141
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,580
I didn't realize how
shabby the place looked.

142
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
What? He came?

143
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,676
Yeah, he was gonna ask
me for a weapons appraisal

144
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,596
but he changed his mind.

145
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,250
Go out? On your own?

146
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,160
He waits... he waits for me to
leave? He comes when you're alone?

147
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,476
He changed his mind, so

148
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,370
I rode back with him this
afternoon, he never mentioned it.

149
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,806
- It happened.
- I know it happened, bix.

150
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,516
That... that's not what I'm saying.

151
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,750
What is that?

152
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,750
He knows you need a rest.

153
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,120
- I would have gone if he asked.
- That's not the point.

154
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,620
He's so pissed off,
he's not gonna tell me?

155
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,500
He has to know we're
having this conversation.

156
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,120
He doesn't do anything without a reason.

157
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,580
Maybe he just wants us to
waste our time talking about it.

158
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,580
Maybe.

159
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,976
That leaves senator rhodi,
senator plada, danascar,

160
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,806
we can't possibly make them all...

161
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,346
If we... if we skip the girvan banquet,

162
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,056
then we could just about
make the whole night work.

163
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,516
And we can't leave sculdun's early.

164
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,830
No, no, no. We'll finish there.

165
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,476
Why so difficult this
season? You never struggle.

166
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,660
It's these dinners.

167
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,556
I mean, how many years did you
serve before we held a ceremony dinner?

168
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,450
I count eighty. Eighty new senators,
all hosting "investiture banquets."

169
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,450
It's tough squeezing a whole year's
worth of insincerity into three nights.

170
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,910
You'll figure it out.

171
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,766
This was a very poor decision.

172
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,976
You come to the house
and you mess with bix?

173
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,766
You mess with her behind my back?

174
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,976
You realize what you're
putting at risk right now?

175
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,306
It would have been so
easy for you to tell me.

176
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,596
When you leave here,
and that will be immediately,

177
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,426
you'll have brought a medallion
that was missing from a shipment

178
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,500
that kleya took this
afternoon. A darvian medallion.

179
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,306
So, thank you for this.
Coming all this way.

180
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,386
What's wrong with you?

181
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,556
This is the second time
today you let me down.

182
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,056
You had to know she would tell me.

183
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,226
I thought it would be
interesting if she didn't,

184
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,976
but now you've both disappointed me.

185
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,726
And that's what's most important, right?

186
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,620
- How it goes for you!
- What's most important is the cause!

187
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,620
"Kill me or take me in."

188
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,660
You're in!

189
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,426
"But ghorman looks too
painful. Bix is too vulnerable."

190
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,620
- I give you everything.
- This is everything?

191
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,556
This fury? This lack of control?

192
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,580
Violating every protocol we live by?

193
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,450
Soft on ghorman but willing
to protect bix at any cost.

194
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,016
We... we are not droids, luthen.

195
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,450
We are not who we
were when we started.

196
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,226
Bix has to pull it together.

197
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,516
Or you will have to decide at what
point it becomes too large a problem.

198
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,426
Unless that's what
you're doing right now.

199
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,950
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

200
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,226
That's gonna be up to you.

201
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,596
I want her as strong as you do.

202
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,450
It would just be easier if I was alone.

203
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,000
I came with you to be part of something.

204
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,500
You want my blood?
You help me work this out.

205
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,660
Thank you for the medallion.
Coming all this way.

206
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,176
Morning, gentlemen.

207
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,370
Just who I wanted to
see. Save us all a meeting.

208
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,476
Dr. Gorst. Success invites scrutiny.

209
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,636
Our cousins in military
intelligence have been salivating

210
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,926
over our interrogation results

211
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,766
and have convinced the emperor

212
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,926
that Dr. Gorst is too valuable
to be a one-man, isb asset.

213
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,766
He's to be expanded into a program.

214
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,200
Sorry to hear that, sir.

215
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,636
The Navy's donated a
facility here in Coruscant.

216
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,500
I want the two of you to
represent our interests in this.

217
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,346
I'm counting on you to
keep watch on these idiots.

218
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,540
An honor, sir.

219
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,370
Really?

220
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,176
It's an assignment.
Calibrate your enthusiasm.

221
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Yes, sir.

222
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,540
We'll have a brief sent down.

223
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,176
You're taking the lead on this.

224
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,636
Why did I say that?

225
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,660
- Fill me in after you've read the brief.
- What?

226
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,080
Any trouble getting through?

227
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,910
It was easy.

228
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,200
My hair.

229
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,450
I like it.

230
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,790
I forget about it.

231
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,290
The gear?

232
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,910
The kid took it.

233
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,710
- Do you know where it's going?
- It's not far.

234
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,080
Thought we should meet first.

235
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,056
I was told they don't
know what they are doing.

236
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,360
That's why we're not doing much.

237
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,370
It's fast, it's simple.

238
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,330
You brought the fuses?

239
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,620
More than enough.

240
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,830
We get a look at it tonight?

241
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,790
And the crew. Whole thing.

242
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,950
If we don't like it, we walk.

243
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,580
I told luthen that I would only take
this assignment if you were on it.

244
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,750
You're the only reason I'm here.

245
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,040
I had an accident.

246
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,660
I told him not to tell
you. I knew you'd worry.

247
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,700
What happened?

248
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,540
I'll tell you about it someday.

249
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,120
It's been a long year.

250
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,950
I had to rest up for a while.

251
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,120
Quite a while.

252
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,250
I had time to think.

253
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,040
Wish I'd known.

254
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,370
I thought about you.

255
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,040
Can I help you?

256
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,250
Um, I'll have what she's having.

257
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,886
- Our friend in ghorman?
- He's just reached out, sir.

258
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,176
There's an isb field agent on-site.

259
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,426
They believe a rebel attack is imminent.

260
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,926
There's been a rapid
increase in local activity.

261
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,500
- And the shipments are running smoothly?
- Yes, sir.

262
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,750
You walk a very narrow path, dedra.

263
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,766
Syril must never know
what this is all really about.

264
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,790
I remind myself constantly, sir.

265
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,676
What's the fastest they could get here?

266
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,330
Eight minutes. And
we can slow them down.

267
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,580
Let's call it six minutes.

268
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,330
That's six minutes from
the moment we go loud.

269
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,386
Time's up.

270
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,700
We leave with what we
have. We don't get greedy.

271
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,056
We need all the weapons we can get.

272
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,346
We're not just here to make a point.

273
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,766
Some of us want to protect ourselves.

274
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,790
Don't.

275
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,040
- "Don't" what?
- Don't talk.

276
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,830
Don't think.

277
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,620
Do as you are told.

278
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,950
If you can't manage that,
you don't belong here.

279
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,000
The staging area feels right.

280
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,426
There should be just enough
time between the transports

281
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,790
to do what we need to do.

282
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,950
Tell me about the neighborhood.

283
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,676
Three families here.
Another two at the back.

284
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,426
- Both with children.
- This building is empty at night.

285
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,200
But there is five units here,
two in front, three at the alley.

286
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,450
Do we control these rooftops?

287
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,676
Most of them.

288
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,540
And we can always lock a few doors.

289
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,476
Fine. Let's talk about the back end.

290
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,290
Every person in this room needs
at least two alternative exit plans.

291
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,750
Down below, you're
driving the transport, right?

292
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,096
That's our ride out.

293
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,476
You're the end of our line.

294
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,016
Which means you do not
move under any circumstances

295
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,386
until you are told to do so.

296
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,200
By who? By you?

297
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,306
I live here. We've put a lot into this.

298
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,250
Your time means nothing.

299
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,120
Prep is useless if you can't follow orders.

300
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,346
You ready?

301
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,580
It's not so hard.

302
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,500
Show me.

303
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,620
It's a good plan.

304
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,976
You've picked the right spot.

305
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,926
Nobody needs weapons.
Everyone has a way out.

306
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,290
But right now, it is just a plan.

307
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,040
We're here because you've
never done anything like this.

308
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,976
I can't stress this enough.

309
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,806
You're all going to need to
respect the chain of command.

310
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,926
Cinta and I will have
blasters. Nobody else.

311
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,016
And I mean nobody.

312
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,886
We will drop the carrier.

313
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,226
We'll drop it and cover
you for six minutes after that.

314
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,596
But we do not go

315
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,290
unless everyone here agrees to
do exactly as they've been told.

316
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,676
If that's not possible, this
would be the time to say so.

317
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,596
- You mean, now?
- Right now.

318
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,410
When are you planning to do this?

319
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,410
Tomorrow night.

320
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,226
Intelligence gets stale.

321
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,830
You might be too late already.

322
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,136
Tomorrow it is.

323
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Bix?

324
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,040
It's flashing.

325
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,790
Whatever the mission is, I'm coming.

326
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,410
Do you hear me?

327
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,370
Hey. Hey.

328
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,500
You'll come with me.

329
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,160
What do you think?

330
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,290
Well, they're not stupid.

331
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,330
We have the trigger.

332
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,950
If it doesn't feel right, we'll walk away.

333
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,910
The driver, dreena...

334
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,516
She should be up top with us.

335
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,790
Did she say something else?

336
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,330
Just a feeling.

337
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,330
They must have another driver.

338
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,870
I'm sorry I hurt you.

339
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,660
I was...

340
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,580
Confused.

341
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,580
I don't know who I am sometimes.

342
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm not perfect either.

343
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,910
You make yourself change.

344
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,450
I've never done that.

345
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,660
Luthen should have told
me you were in trouble.

346
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,200
I wasn't thinking clearly.

347
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,330
All the more reason.

348
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,200
He shouldn't have let you say no.

349
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,950
He should have told me.

350
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,330
We're worth more to him
separately than together.

351
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,540
Well, that's something we'll
have to talk to him about.

352
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,620
Upon my life and honor...

353
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,426
Life and honor...

354
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,700
For the peace and bounty of all beings...

355
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:12,516
Peace and bounty... My full allegiance...

356
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,766
Full allegiance... A galaxy of worlds...

357
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,676
A galaxy of worlds...
A galaxy assembled...

358
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,516
A galaxy assembled... An empire!

359
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
Driver's here.

360
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,016
Senator mothma.

361
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,410
Senator organ a.

362
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,266
- Perrin.
- Bail. How are you?

363
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,346
I'm free. That was my last
investiture party of the season.

364
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,846
Don't tell me you've left
poor breha up there all alone.

365
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:00,516
No, we had to split up to cover
the rounds. I drew sculdun.

366
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,226
- Yes. We almost did that. But...
- not tonight.

367
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,176
No, you're family now.

368
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,160
You're in for the show. Good luck with it.

369
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,120
This is an imperial security protocol.

370
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,766
I need all personnel
to exit the control center

371
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,926
immediately for security reasons.

372
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,000
Let's go.

373
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,160
Apologies for any inconvenience.

374
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,476
Senator mothma, over here!

375
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,846
- There you are. Party trail refugees.
- We made it.

376
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,016
Took us long enough.

377
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,306
Have you spoken to the
children since they've been back?

378
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,226
- We must.
- We must absolutely.

379
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,636
When the festivities are over.

380
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,386
Thank you, senator mothma.

381
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,250
They're just setting up now.

382
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,266
Are we on schedule with
the targeted shipment?

383
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:35,080
Yes, sir. We're all set here.

384
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,580
- How do they seem?
- They're on time.

385
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,040
Be careful in that tunnel.

386
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,370
Pre-carvian. Third millennium.

387
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,266
It's a good guess.

388
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:06,516
The stone is carvian,
but it's older, isn't it?

389
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,056
We think it's lost empire.

390
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,846
My word, luthen. And you wear it out?

391
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,556
I thought one of you thieves
might make me an offer.

392
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,200
It takes one to know one, luthen.

393
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,886
I don't know what to do, kleya.
I am sick about this forgery.

394
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,096
- I'm sorry.
- Sculdun's been relentless.

395
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,330
Yeah, I'm sure.

396
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,250
You haven't told luthen about
the reappraisals, have you?

397
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,250
No, I promised, didn't I?

398
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,660
- Yeah, sorry...
- Don't worry.

399
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,500
This is actually better than my fantasy.

400
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,660
Soak it up. We'll never
be back here again.

401
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,450
Speak for yourself.

402
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,830
How did you two get in here?

403
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,516
We come every year.

404
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,410
Partagaz had an emergency
and tossed us the invites.

405
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,620
- Where's your buddy?
- He'll be here.

406
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,806
What are we drinking?

407
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,200
Kali coolers, and they're amazing.

408
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,290
This is my third one.

409
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,330
Dispatch confirmed. We're in the queue.

410
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,080
Repeat, we're up next.

411
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,516
Everyone take your
positions and be ready.

412
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,976
Thank you.

413
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,540
A new season of legislative initiative.

414
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,750
How thrilling.

415
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,750
Always looking on the bright side.

416
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,160
I haven't heard from my cousin.

417
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,250
She's probably just being careful.

418
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,410
Well, tell her to check in with me.

419
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,160
Something urgent she needs knowing?

420
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,660
Yes. I care about her.

421
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:39,870
Showtime. The sculdun collection awaits.

422
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,596
We're discreetly gathering the chosen.

423
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,660
What fun. I just happen to
have my history teacher with me.

424
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,676
Yeah, we're coming, we're
coming. We'll see you there.

425
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,830
Lonni.

426
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,950
Perhaps you remember me. Kleya.

427
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,370
You came by the shop to
find something for your wife.

428
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,176
- What are you doing here?
- We had a fascinating conversation.

429
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,250
Your friends will think we're flirting.
There's no harm in that, is there?

430
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,676
Are you out of your mind?

431
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,370
Do as I say and everything will be fine.

432
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,330
Target is en route.

433
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,726
We always like to feature something
fresh to the collection up front,

434
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,540
and this is our latest addition.

435
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,676
And the miracle man who helped
secure this very special piece

436
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,540
is actually here with us tonight.

437
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,806
Director krennic, luthen rael.

438
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,620
What a pleasure.

439
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,386
How kind you are.

440
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,056
Senator mothma, perrin fertha,
I'm sure you've met before.

441
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,976
Yes. I've been a guest at her
committee on several occasions.

442
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,870
How pleasant to see you
free of the witness stand.

443
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:17,766
What a festive evening this has become.

444
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,976
So, tell me what we're looking at.

445
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,806
Yes. The lost tairn. This
is a very rare, special piece

446
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,660
we're very lucky to have acquired.

447
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,516
I'm showing you something special.

448
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,636
Is it from carmeen?

449
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,806
Do you have any idea
who's in this room right now?

450
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,080
You're not smiling.

451
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,096
This is suicide.

452
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,306
It's my favorite object in the collection.
I was heartbroken when we sold it.

453
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,620
Luthen will tell them that's why
I'm so keen on visiting with it.

454
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,000
They've done it. The carrier's down.

455
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,660
Repeat, the carrier is down.

456
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,410
We're in play.

457
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,846
There's only three like it that we know of.

458
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,976
This... this is the one
that was left behind

459
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,620
during the battle of carmeen.

460
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:48,056
There's a stone carving that
depicts three identical tairns

461
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,636
mounted on the altar of the
grand carmeenian forest...

462
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,636
- Isn't it beautiful?
- You're risking everything.

463
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,080
Move slightly to your left.

464
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,040
Tell me what you're doing.

465
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,306
I'm removing a listening
device from this piece

466
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:04,346
and you're going to help
me by blocking the view.

467
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,870
You can't possibly be serious.

468
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,846
The tinian codex was
forged 2000 years ago

469
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:13,306
on a planet where sight
was considered a disability.

470
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,306
And what were you
gonna do if I wasn't here?

471
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,516
Anything I had to.

472
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,766
This is do-or-die, lonni,
so move to your left,

473
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,120
and listen closely
because we may be tested.

474
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,870
That's a great story.

475
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,790
Go.

476
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,330
That one, open.

477
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,580
We're good, move.

478
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,540
We're good.

479
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,386
This piece will eventually,
as my greed subsides

480
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,846
join its sisters in the whole of history.

481
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,330
We'll make an event of it.

482
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,830
Don't rush. Smooth is faster.

483
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,846
There's a bit of a theme
on this side of the gallery.

484
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,000
There's a carmeenian helmet.

485
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,636
It's a few centuries
after the grand conflict.

486
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,830
We studied the battle of
carmeen at the isb academy.

487
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,660
Well, it wasn't much of a battle, was it?

488
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,886
No, how right you are... Tinians believed

489
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,200
all language could be reduced to touch.

490
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,766
Their skin was so sensitive.

491
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,726
Very few carmeenians
lived to tell the tale.

492
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,976
You know how it is.

493
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,766
Insurgencies have a long
history of puffing up their failures.

494
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,910
We were taught it was
a systematic execution.

495
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,910
Well, that is exactly my point.

496
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,540
Criminals love to lie.

497
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:20,790
After all, who wants to
die for "lawless ineptitude"?

498
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,426
Well... How much longer?

499
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
It's stuck.

500
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,500
They're offloading.

501
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,870
I count at least six.

502
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,750
They're using the spillway
tunnels. They're moving quickly.

503
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,386
The shedian word for
"memory" is almost identical

504
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,330
to their word for "revenge"...

505
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,250
What are you doing?

506
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,620
- Shift right.
- They're almost here.

507
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,500
I'm walking away.

508
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,346
Do as I say.

509
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:10,370
Was meant to be a cathartic
curse written into the stone.

510
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,580
Zippe, zippe, zippe!

511
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:29,056
You seem fixated on defining
people by their resistance to power.

512
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,596
Words do still have meaning.

513
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,886
As I'm sure we can still agree on that.

514
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,926
What's the word for
people like the carmeen

515
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,016
who simply wish to be left alone?

516
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,346
Vulnerable.

517
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,766
What's the word for people
who skin trespassers alive?

518
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,886
- Is that what they did?
- It was a very long time ago.

519
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,950
Well, they had their
own code of conduct.

520
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,620
My rebel is your terrorist.
Something like that?

521
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,016
What a swell party this is.

522
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,476
Let us continue.

523
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,370
- Put both hands on top.
- Why?

524
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,580
Hold it steady.

525
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,540
One minute warning.

526
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,346
Have you seen dreena?

527
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,016
Let's go. Last few boxes.

528
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,290
- She's not here.
- She wandered off.

529
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,016
- We're not waiting.
- We have a minute.

530
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,620
I'll clean up the fuses.

531
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,410
Help them finish.

532
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,830
Okay, let's wrap it up. We're leaving now.

533
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:45,266
This piece was just laying in
plain sight. Totally unrecognized.

534
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:48,806
Not as a cloak rack, but as a
ballast for a swamp freighter.

535
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,120
Shots fired.

536
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
One shot.

537
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,056
No. No.

538
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,580
I can't see it from here.

539
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,830
- I can't move.
- Never mind that.

540
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,346
Call the response team.

541
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:23,806
And come in loud, make sure
they know we're on the way.

542
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,516
Jacquème! Jacquème! Lo stique sassor!

543
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,040
Nache mik balor! Sim ro nache telpó!

544
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,726
Hey, you need to stand, we
have to move. Look at me.

545
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,346
I... I need help.

546
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,556
We have to go, okay? We have to go.

547
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,660
I can take her. I can take her.

548
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:05,290
Tinian codex...

549
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,790
Isn't it lovely?

550
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:17,950
I understand that this piece is...

551
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:21,000
It's a favorite of yours.

552
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:23,910
It's very special.

553
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,580
Why?

554
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,870
It's a book.

555
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:38,540
You read by touch, your hand.

556
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,096
It's from a planet where
blindness was considered a gift.

557
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,056
Well, I'm sure we can
all think of some people

558
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,426
who would be right at home.

559
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,540
Feel free to touch.

560
00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:00,250
I often find myself wandering
by and closing my eyes...

561
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,016
To wonder at another world.

562
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,950
Come on. We have to go.

563
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,750
Are you crying?

564
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:15,120
Are you?

565
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:17,950
Look at me.

566
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,830
Look at me!

567
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,790
There's no place to hide. Look at me.

568
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,250
I'm not going to say "remember
this," because I don't have to.

569
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,040
This is on you now.

570
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:41,950
This is like skin.

571
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,596
You're taking her with you wherever
you go for the rest of your useless life.

572
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,886
Don't you look away from me.

573
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:52,660
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- She was a warrior.

574
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,750
She was everything that
you have daydreamed about.

575
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,766
She was a blooded, fearless warrior

576
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:06,250
whose loss will be mourned in
ways that you will never understand.

577
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,620
She was a miracle.

578
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,790
And you...

579
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,250
To die like this because of you...

580
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:24,306
Some whining, simpering, foolish child.

581
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:27,160
Don't you dare cry.

582
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,120
You'll make up for this forever.

583
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,250
What fun.

584
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:50,700
You're welcome.

585
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,386
My face hurts from smiling.

586
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,250
Complain all you like, it worked.

587
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,516
We should have killed
krennic while we were up there.

588
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,200
That's the spirit.

589
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:48,766
Get in the chair.

590
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:50,660
- I know you.
- Get in the chair!

591
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,016
How do I know

592
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,000
it will only feel like forever.

593
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,950
Hey! Who are you?

594
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:54,926
Nobody's allowed in here.
