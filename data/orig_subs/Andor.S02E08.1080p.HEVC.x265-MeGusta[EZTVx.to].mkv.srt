1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,726
There's a mineral underground. Doctor!

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,186
Deep substrate foliated kalkite.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,016
Should we fail to find any alternatives,

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,186
we will have to control
ghorman with a hand firm enough

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,806
to silence any resistance,

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,830
and you've been selected to
help plan for that possibility.

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,226
You need a radical
insurgency you can count on.

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,686
You need ghorman rebels you
can depend on to do the wrong thing.

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,396
Ghorman is a single-product economy.

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,646
We import almost
everything we need to survive.

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,312
I am constantly begging
my people to stay calm

12
00:00:39,336 --> 00:00:41,436
<i>and do nothing that
might make things worse.</i>

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,936
The plan... your plan to bait
ghorman as a prize for outside agitators

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,630
needs to begin somewhere.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,936
Luthen wants to know
if you're ready to work.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,396
What does he need me for?

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,476
Isb supervisor, dedra meero.

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,686
She's there in ghorman.

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,226
She's there waiting to be killed.

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,766
We're drowning in rumors, syril.

21
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,766
<i>Many people are starting to think this
new building is more than just an annex.</i>

22
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,476
<i>I'm not sure why the empire would
build an armory in the middle of palmo,</i>

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,186
but I'm running out of answers.

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,186
There is, apparently,
no suitable replacement

25
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,976
or synthetic alternative for
the ghorman substrate material.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,016
<i>I don't know the science,
but it's bad luck ghorman.</i>

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,290
She's in there.

28
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,790
She sleeps in the building.

29
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,856
<i>I've seen her on the terrace.</i>

30
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,226
I have a room at the
front, facing the Plaza.

31
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,306
Perfect.

32
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,056
You know, most guests don't
say that anymore. It can be loud.

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,556
I'm a deep sleeper.

34
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,580
You walk a very narrow path, dedra.

35
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,606
Syril must never know
what this is all really about.

36
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,550
Good things are waiting for us.

37
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,540
We'll be out of here soon.

38
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,476
We'll be back in
Coruscant. We'll be together.

39
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,920
We'll be rewarded.

40
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,210
For what? What have we accomplished?

41
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,130
Captain kaido is arriving today.

42
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,226
<i>He'll be bringing a variety of
personnel to help manage the situation.</i>

43
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,750
You're aware, sir, that the
insurgents have weapons at this point.

44
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,910
We're counting on it.

45
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,290
Let's go!

46
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,340
I want it done quickly. Double time!

47
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,130
Get that one ready next!

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,130
Help him, then.

49
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,750
One on each side.

50
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,460
Come on, soldier, look lively!

51
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,330
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

52
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,750
Come on, you! Look lively!

53
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,750
Get that one ready next!

54
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,210
Move with purpose. Let's go!

55
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,516
Cassian.

56
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,620
What is all this?

57
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,396
<i>Did you know about this?</i>

58
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,562
Know about what?

59
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:39,056
<i>They're pulling it all in.</i>

60
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,160
Pulling what from where?

61
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,550
The barricades. What's going on here?

62
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,056
- They're opening the Plaza.
- You hear that?

63
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,356
- I'm looking at it.
- They're not opening anything.

64
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,420
They're putting a shell
around the building.

65
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,550
- What do you mean?
- I won't get a shot from here.

66
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,630
They're building a fortress.

67
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,290
- Apologies.
- I know you've been waiting.

68
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,856
There's reports coming
in from the countryside.

69
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,476
They're saying we've landed mining rigs.

70
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,540
You seem animated.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,806
Rumors spread quickly these days.

72
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,976
Well, I'm sure captain kaido
has his assets in position.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,606
<i>That's why I thought it urgent we speak.</i>

74
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,686
He's given orders to
barricade the building.

75
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,670
<i>I saw that. Seems a wise idea.</i>

76
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,896
The mining equipment. Already on site.

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,146
Is that a story director
krennic wants to be telling?

78
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,856
<i>We're done with local rumors.</i>

79
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,856
<i>The only story that matters
is ghorman aggression.</i>

80
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,420
The threats. The inexplicable
resistance to imperial norms.

81
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,330
<i>We need what's in the ground.</i>

82
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,290
<i>The empire has been
patient long enough.</i>

83
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,830
Our struggles with ghorman
are well documented at this point.

84
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,420
Samm.

85
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,766
The continued and inexplicable
ghorman resistance to imperial norms.

86
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,556
Many people, even some
ghormans, have already been asking

87
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,726
how long the empire's
Patience can be tested.

88
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,016
And here we are this morning

89
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,516
with rumors of a general
strike and mass demonstrations

90
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,606
how the imperial authorities
can calm the situation down.

91
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,146
<i>The casualties from yesterday's
bombing of the naval depot</i>

92
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,856
<i>are still yet to be finalized.</i>

93
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,436
<i>The fear is the numbers will be
minimized to lower the temperature here.</i>

94
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,790
<i>If that is the case, it certainly
doesn't seem to be working.</i>

95
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,726
<i>There were mass
curfew violations last night</i>

96
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,040
<i>and rumors of a general
strike this morning.</i>

97
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,186
Sorry, sir. Comms are
down. We're making rounds.

98
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,210
Imperial employees are to report
immediately to the ioc building.

99
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,000
Nache-band or!

100
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:48,710
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!

101
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:03,646
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!

102
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,130
We are the ghor!

103
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,186
You! Karn!

104
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,896
You dare walk our streets?

105
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,750
You dare walk among us?

106
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
All this time, you...

107
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,146
How could we be so foolish?

108
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,550
I meant you no harm.

109
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,840
How do you say that?

110
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,210
How do you speak the words?

111
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
You've destroyed us.

112
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,356
I was here to trap outside agitators.

113
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,090
Look at you. Even now...

114
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,880
People know what you're doing.

115
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,306
We've had reports all night.

116
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,976
There's mining equipment
being dropped all over the planet.

117
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,356
- Rigs and droids and...
- that's a rumor!

118
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,010
Are you mad?

119
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,460
That I'd believe that?

120
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,710
That it's worth saying?

121
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,630
What kind of a being are you?

122
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,300
What's in our ground?

123
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,300
What is it you've been
sent to steal from us?

124
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,790
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!

125
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,540
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!

126
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,830
Everything as you wanted?

127
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,130
What I want is a comfortable ride home.

128
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,880
But let's not confuse
the chain of command.

129
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm the trigger, supervisor.
You're the finger.

130
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,160
Make sure you're available.

131
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,016
I'm not sure I'll be back.

132
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,960
Not to worry. You were never here.

133
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,130
Didn't log you in.

134
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Hey, I hope things work out for you.

135
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,960
Rebellions are built on hope.

136
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:48,630
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!

137
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,500
Help him. Radio.

138
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,976
Don't make me look for you again.

139
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,056
No, sir.

140
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Get the south steps unit on the line.

141
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,856
The galaxy is watching!

142
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:40,090
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!

143
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,606
A peaceful demonstration,
local insurgents

144
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,106
the galaxy is watching!

145
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,516
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!

146
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,620
Enza!

147
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,226
The galaxy is watching!

148
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,710
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!

149
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,630
Can you hear me?

150
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,460
- Cassian!
- Where are you?

151
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,210
Wil?

152
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,686
Can you hear me?

153
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,766
Where are you?

154
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,500
Repeat. Where are you? Talk to me.

155
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,040
- No way through.
- I work here.

156
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,266
- Hey! Hey! Over here!
- Let him in.

157
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,356
He knows me.

158
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,396
Even though imperial officials strive

159
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,726
to desperately negotiate
a peaceful demonstration,

160
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,936
the local insurgents spread
rumors through the night

161
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,646
and have organized this...

162
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,106
This highly volatile insurrection
you see behind me now.

163
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,300
Sir, we need to go.

164
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,516
I need to get upstairs.

165
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,016
Just be a minute, sir.

166
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,960
Just making sure we're all safe.

167
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,210
Over here.

168
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,410
Just be a minute until things calm down.

169
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:10,040
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!

170
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,646
Close all the exits.

171
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,920
Yes, sir.

172
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,856
Channel five is open?

173
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,050
Standing by, sir.

174
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,540
South gate, unit one, come in.

175
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,550
It'll be all right. Stay with cap so.

176
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,420
I have to go find my friend.

177
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,646
Patrol, sir? Within the crowd?

178
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,436
Was that not my order?

179
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,356
They're green, sir. They're useless.

180
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,670
I see imperial uniforms, sergeant.

181
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,436
I see a barricade Lane to the
memorial that I need kept open.

182
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,266
You will march them out there
immediately and secure the area.

183
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,370
Or you can all finish your
days in an imperial brig.

184
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,130
Stand to!

185
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:30,960
We are the ghor! The galaxy is watching!

186
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,000
Wait! Hang on, I said wait!

187
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,210
What have you done?

188
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,306
Get out.

189
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,580
Close it.

190
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,436
What are we doing here?

191
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,250
Following orders.

192
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,670
How long have you known about all this?

193
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,290
How long?

194
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,790
We can discuss this later.

195
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,726
It is too late already.

196
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,806
Syril, please.

197
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,106
You're gonna tell me what
this has really been about.

198
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,476
- You're hurting me.
- And you are going to tell me

199
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,516
what the mining ships are doing here.

200
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,870
- They're not...
- there is an armada up there!

201
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,500
They're already unloading
in jel-novi and leequa.

202
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,380
- You couldn't even wait.
- No

203
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
don't.

204
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,160
You tell me it's a rumor and I
will throw you out that window.

205
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,540
What have we been doing here?

206
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,226
There's a stone.
Something in the dirt here.

207
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,186
They need it. It's the energy program.

208
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,436
It's directly from the emperor.

209
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,920
It's something they can't do
without. They need the planet.

210
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,710
How long have you known this?

211
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,630
We're going home, syril.

212
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,800
We're going home as heroes.

213
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,410
This began long before we got here.

214
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,670
They've been planning it for years.

215
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,370
They're doing this no matter what.

216
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,920
We wanted to be together.

217
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,960
You didn't seem to mind the promotions.

218
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,090
Good luck, dedra.

219
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,460
Move out.

220
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,420
Eyes open. Keep it moving.

221
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,460
Sir.

222
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,920
Sir!

223
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,516
Find syril. Bring him back. Do
not let him leave the building.

224
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,120
Partagaz is on the line.

225
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,227
Move out!

226
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:39,130
Close! Close!

227
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,396
- Wilmon.
- Tell me where you are.

228
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,016
West Side. The
columns by the cafhouse.

229
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,686
- Find me.
- I can't hear you.

230
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,880
Find me.

231
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,130
Hold the line!

232
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,580
Orders, please.

233
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,540
Supervisor meero.

234
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,396
Proceed.

235
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,630
Put him on.

236
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,380
Channel five? Open.

237
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,960
One transmit five. One calling five.

238
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,300
Five online. Standing by.

239
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,460
Fire at will. Repeat. Fire at will.

240
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,840
Get back! Get back!

241
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,160
Withdraw! Withdraw!

242
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,250
Withdraw!

243
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,170
Man down! Get him out of here!

244
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,340
Open fire!

245
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,880
Behind you!

246
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,420
Retreat and fire!

247
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,040
Keep the formation!

248
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,420
Incoming!

249
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Bottle!

250
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,290
Get down!

251
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,540
Balor!

252
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,830
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

253
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,750
Get back! Get back!

254
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,460
Run!

255
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,620
He's out there.

256
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,630
Supervisor, it's not safe.

257
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,370
Put them out there.

258
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,960
Get back! Come on!

259
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,960
Run!

260
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:56,160
Help! Help!

261
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,460
Who are you?

262
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,840
Cassian!

263
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,920
Come on, let's go.

264
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,250
Come on. Yeah.

265
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,766
You okay?

266
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,620
I'm okay. I'm okay.

267
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,436
We need to move.

268
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,670
I'm okay. I'm okay.

269
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,120
Capso! Hey!

270
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,790
Where's dreena?

271
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,266
She ran. She was with
us. We never had a chance.

272
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,606
Where is she?

273
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,976
They went for the radio.

274
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,726
She might have been with them.

275
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,170
I have to find my brother!

276
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,476
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

277
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,556
- I'm not leaving without dreena.
- No, no, no, no, no!

278
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,146
- I've gotta find her!
- Wilmon, stop!

279
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,356
- We have to leave.
- It's not far.

280
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,356
Hey. Everything is far.
We need a ride to the ship.

281
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,760
Look at me!

282
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,750
Run!

283
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,420
Don't stop!

284
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,040
Get up, get up! Get up!

285
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,840
Cassian!

286
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,380
Is it dead?

287
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,250
You killed it.

288
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,920
Hey, I know you.

289
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,920
- Samm.
- I remember you.

290
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,630
Thank you.

291
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,266
I have to get to the hq.

292
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,516
That's where I'm going.

293
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,766
- Okay.
- No, we're leaving!

294
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,370
I told you I can't.

295
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,250
You go. I'll be all right. You'll see.

296
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,420
Wil, please.

297
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,630
I can't leave her behind.

298
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,040
Tell people what happened here, cass.

299
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,830
Ferrix.

300
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,750
Stone and sky.

301
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,960
Wait!

302
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,340
One last favor.

303
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,856
Palmo one.

304
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,976
<i>This is palmo one. This
is the voice of ghorman.</i>

305
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,766
<i>This is palmo one making
an emergency broadcast</i>

306
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,460
<i>on all open channels.</i>

307
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,460
<i>This is palmo one! This is palmo one.</i>

308
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,806
<i>We are under siege.
We're being slaughtered.</i>

309
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,580
<i>The imperial murder
of ghorman has begun.</i>

310
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,562
<i>There are hundreds
of bodies this moment.</i>

311
00:39:43,586 --> 00:39:45,016
<i>As I say these words,</i>

312
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,540
<i>hundreds of murdered
ghormans lay dead in palmo Plaza.</i>

313
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,306
<i>Thousands more on the
streets. More every minute.</i>

314
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,290
<i>We're being destroyed!</i>

315
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:00,016
<i>This is ghorman reaching for
any open channel that can hear me!</i>

316
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,436
<i>If you can... if you can hear me...</i>

317
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,856
<i>If you believe in truth, if
you have any faith left in truth,</i>

318
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,300
<i>please, please Mark this
message and pass it forward.</i>

319
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,670
<i>This is murder!</i>

320
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,516
<i>The empire built this fire.</i>

321
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,686
<i>They made this fire and
led us to the slaughter.</i>

322
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,420
<i>Now they expect us to
die without knowing why.</i>

323
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,266
<i>The conspiracy we've feared is real!</i>

324
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,750
<i>It's here today!</i>

325
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,660
<i>Imperial ships are already landing across</i>

326
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,370
no!

327
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,436
Help us!

328
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,090
Is there no one who can help us?

329
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,436
Is there no one?

330
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,420
Dreena!

331
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,210
I found you.

332
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,210
We gotta let people know
what happened. Help me.

333
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:06,186
<i>Even as imperial security forces
are still assessing casualties,</i>

334
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:10,766
<i>even as our fallen heroes are
beginning their final journeys home,</i>

335
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:15,686
<i>questions are being asked about
how an insurrection of this scale</i>

336
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,356
<i>could be mounted
without the aid and support</i>

337
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,670
<i>of outside rebel assistance.</i>

338
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,896
<i>In the days to come,</i>

339
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,976
<i>as the imperial martyrs
of ghorman are mourned,</i>

340
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,976
<i>we're sure to learn a great deal
more about what happened here today</i>

341
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,210
<i>and the price we'll
pay for our own safety.</i>
