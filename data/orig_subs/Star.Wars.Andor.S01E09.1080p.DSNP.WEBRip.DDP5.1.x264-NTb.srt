1
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:03,416
Six years.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,892
- No, no, wait!
- Take him.

3
00:00:04,916 --> 00:00:06,000
Change of guidelines.

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,958
- I didn't do anything! Hey!
- Take it up with the Emperor.

5
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,333
I'm just a tourist!

6
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,583
<i>Welcome to Narkina Five.</i>

7
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,125
<i>This is an Imperial factory facility.</i>

8
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,625
<i>You've all been assessed as labor-worthy.</i>

9
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,000
<i>It's the shop owner on Ferrix.</i>

10
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,250
She's looking for Cassian Andor.
His mother is ill.

11
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,392
<i>She may have a lead.</i>

12
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,056
Likely, the ISB working her radio.

13
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,958
- You're guessing!
- And you're slipping.

14
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,083
<i>My name is Kino Loy.</i>

15
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm the Five-Two-D unit manager.

16
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,708
<i>The forty-nine men
in this room answer to me.</i>

17
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,875
You see the white lights?
That's the floor.

18
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,500
<i>White is cold, red is hot.</i>

19
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,250
<i>They doubled everyone's
number last month.</i>

20
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,333
<i>P-O-R-D.</i>

21
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,517
<i>He's never heard of it.</i>

22
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,976
<i>- The resentencings.</i>
- I don't know anything about it.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,309
Don't look at the number.

24
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,559
- You're here 'til they don't want you.
- Melshi!

25
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,416
Get straight with that? Your worries...

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,583
That's enough.

27
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,583
You have engaged the curiosity of the ISB.

28
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,166
I'm just trying to clear my name.

29
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,958
One would think
you'd want to leave Ferrix far behind.

30
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,291
One would be wrong.

31
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,416
Caleen!

32
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,083
Bix Caleen.

33
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,625
- Run!
- Get her!

34
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,017
- No, no, no, no!
- He railed it!

35
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,101
- Who?
- Veemoss!

36
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,392
You're the ones gonna be
shorthanded all day tomorrow.

37
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,376
Think about that
when you're gettin' fried.

38
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,541
Hello, Bix.

39
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,875
I don't like wasting time.

40
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,333
But one must be careful.

41
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,541
You pull in the net and the easy thing,

42
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,125
the quick thing,

43
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:56,166
is to assume that everything
you've dragged to shore is a fish.

44
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,416
I have colleagues who believe
that's the prudent mindset

45
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,916
in defense of the Empire.

46
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,666
But I take a more nuanced view.

47
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,458
I try.

48
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,833
So here's what we'll do, Bix.

49
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,333
I'll tell you everything I know,

50
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:19,583
and in doing so, perhaps convince you
to cooperate without intervention.

51
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,000
Failing that,

52
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,666
we have Dr. Gorst,

53
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:28,791
who's developed a unique interview system
some of us are very excited about.

54
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,916
As you now know,
we brought in Salman Paak last night.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,041
We tracked him
to a radio hidden in his yard

56
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,583
and thought he might cooperate
without encouragement.

57
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:40,458
For a man with very little actual
rebellious activity on his resume,

58
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,041
he was remarkably resistant,

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,833
which of course just makes us think
there's more to be learned.

60
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,458
Which leads to a longer session.

61
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,208
And suddenly, it's morning.

62
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:54,375
And there we are, wasting time.

63
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,875
In the end,
it was a very poor decision on his part.

64
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,708
We learned everything we needed to know,

65
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,791
and quite frankly,
it hardly seems worth the price he's paid.

66
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,958
Paak attended a separatist meeting
two years ago in Jondora

67
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,125
where he met a woman who said
that if he was serious about politics,

68
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,583
he might like to act as liaison
for Ferrix when he returned home.

69
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:21,291
He was sent the fractal radio unit
you used yesterday afternoon.

70
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:26,041
Now this unknown woman
who recruited him to the cause

71
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,250
seemed less interested
in generating political activity on Ferrix

72
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:33,000
than she was in using
your planet's unique commercial position

73
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,250
to acquire stolen Imperial equipment.

74
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,750
Did you know Salman Paak
was paid to keep that radio alive?

75
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,125
Did you know
you were the only one to use it?

76
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:49,166
Were you aware that the buyer,
your contact,

77
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,125
met Paak only once
before being turned over to you?

78
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,166
You're in my net, Bix.

79
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,750
Are you a fish or are you a thief, hmm?

80
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,666
Seems a shame
to end up on the carving board

81
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,541
if your motivation here is just money.

82
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,291
You have no recorded history
of political troublemaking.

83
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,833
You're a business owner.

84
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:25,833
Now, I would prefer a conversation
rather than put Dr. Gorst back to work.

85
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:30,916
But that, for the moment,
is entirely up to you.

86
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,458
You're ISB, aren't you?

87
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,958
Worst of the worst.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,875
You're going to tell me absolutely
everything you know about the buyer.

89
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,416
You seem to enjoy this.

90
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:50,291
You're going to tell me all about
Cassian Andor and their relationship.

91
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,958
They don't have a relationship.

92
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:59,083
You will be giving me a full,

93
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:03,333
detailed accounting of every single piece

94
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,000
of stolen Imperial equipment
you've passed along,

95
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,125
where it came from,
who was bribed along the way,

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,166
and where it has gone.

97
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,750
I don't know the buyer.

98
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,458
- Really?
- Really.

99
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:23,166
Well, Salman Paak says you've had
at least six meetings he's aware of.

100
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,750
He says you sit up on that radio
for hours at a time.

101
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,791
I signal.

102
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:38,791
Sometimes he answers,
he comes, he buys, he leaves.

103
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,500
Six face to face meetings.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,333
He and Andor, blowing up buildings
and killing security guards.

105
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,333
You're injured trying to warn them.

106
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,750
Your coworker is killed
trying to win your freedom.

107
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:05,166
Andor and the buyer escape together.

108
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:10,875
It sounds to me
like a nest of relationships.

109
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,875
When was the last time
you spoke with Cassian Andor?

110
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:35,500
The very worst thing
you can do right now is bore me.

111
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,750
You're not gonna
believe me anyway, are you?

112
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,291
No.

113
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,750
I suppose not.

114
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,750
- She's all yours, Dr. Gorst.
- Thank you.

115
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,250
Turn.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,125
Ready?

117
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,416
Your side. Fly.

118
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,333
Table three.

119
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,916
They won't be shorthanded all day.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,541
There's a new man coming down.

121
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,500
But we can take the shift if we push.

122
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,916
- We're already up on Four.
- I could use a proper meal.

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,392
Two, that's a threat.

124
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,541
Ulaf?

125
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,166
- What do you say, old timer?
- Short timer.

126
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,500
Make a run for the win?

127
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,500
My hand. I might need some help.

128
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,666
- Let's switch.
- What?

129
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,184
- Come on.
- He's right. Switch.

130
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,416
- Why?
- Keef is faster.

131
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,791
- There's a better way of saying that.
- The hand.

132
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,500
- What's all this?
- Just a little rebalancing.

133
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,333
- And...
- Ulaf, what do you owe?

134
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,333
Be 41 shifts tomorrow.

135
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,458
You are the next man out.

136
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,250
You are the shortest of the short.

137
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,541
This swap your idea?

138
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,500
Me? No, no. It's Taga.

139
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,916
Are you kiddin'?

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,750
- Turn.
- Wise move.

141
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,541
Ulaf is going home.

142
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,833
New man for them today?

143
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,625
Always the next day, right?

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,250
You know the drill.

145
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,458
Oh, the...
The restraints are nothing to be feared.

146
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,166
It's much safer
for you to be tethered as we engage.

147
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,291
There's nothing intrinsically physical
about this process,

148
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,708
but we've had some early trials
that were a bit chaotic.

149
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,541
There's an Outer Rim moon
called Dizon Fray.

150
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,666
There was a sentient species there,
quite unusual.

151
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,125
Extremely hostile to the concept

152
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,750
of an Imperial refueling center
that was being planned.

153
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,291
I say "was"
because they created such a stir

154
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:05,041
that the local commanders were granted
permission to use any means necessary.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,041
And, um, well, what's important
for our purposes here today

156
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,750
is that the massacre of the Dizonites

157
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,500
was broadcast and recorded
as proof of mission.

158
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,250
They make a sound as they die.

159
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:22,041
A sort of choral, agonized pleading.

160
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,708
It was quite unlike anything
anyone has ever heard before.

161
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,958
There were three communications officers
monitoring the documentation,

162
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,583
and they were found
hours later huddled together

163
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,625
in various states of emotional distress,

164
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,958
in a crawl space
beneath the ship's bridge.

165
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,458
We've taken the recordings

166
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:44,208
and modified them slightly,
layering, adjusting.

167
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:48,375
And we found a section
of what we believe are primarily children,

168
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,000
which has its own particular effect.

169
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,750
Doesn't take long.

170
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,750
It won't feel that way to you inside.
But, um...

171
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,250
Let me know
when you're willing to cooperate.

172
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,166
Oh, and if you're having
difficulty speaking,

173
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,583
just shake your head from side to side.

174
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:29,291
You'll want to be sure of that, Bix,
that you're cooperating fully.

175
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,875
It's repeat listenings
that cause the most damage.

176
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,541
Are we ready?

177
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,666
Let's get on with it.

178
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,708
Drill away.

179
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,291
I'm taking my run.

180
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,500
<i>On program.</i>

181
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,041
<i>New man on the floor.</i>

182
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,958
<i>Everyone, hold positions.</i>

183
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,708
New man on the floor!

184
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,416
Hold your positions!

185
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,083
Step on to the lift and stop.

186
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,333
Two men back. Two weapons.

187
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,291
- Move forward.
- No boots.

188
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,500
...on that lift.

189
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,291
Silence!

190
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,625
He's touching the rail.

191
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,708
Believe me now?

192
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,875
- The elevator's not wired.
- Up!

193
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,416
Nothing that moves can fry you.

194
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,416
I have a new idea.

195
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:43,875
Don't wait.

196
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,500
We attack while they're coming down. Now.

197
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,458
- They'll just go back up.
- No.

198
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,375
We make it stop.

199
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,958
We shut it down half way.

200
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,458
Take one guard, one weapon.

201
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,750
This is Unit Five-Two-D.

202
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,458
Level five, room two.

203
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,125
The "D" is for Day-shift.

204
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,291
The 49 men in this room answer to me.

205
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,750
Don't put them away.

206
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:33,958
Shall we begin?

207
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:41,291
When was the last time
you spoke with Cassian Andor?

208
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,166
- Let me. Let me, let me.
- I can do it.

209
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,375
- I know.
- Ready up.

210
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,875
I'm ready.

211
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,000
Ready now.

212
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,375
Where do we stand?

213
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,750
Are we in the game?

214
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,916
We're up a rack with an hour left.

215
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What? What's on now?

216
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,333
We just talked about this.

217
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,375
We told you two minutes ago.

218
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,291
Do you think I don't wanna win?

219
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,416
Am I working or not?

220
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,208
One rack up. Ours to lose.

221
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,971
- Turn.
- What are you waiting for?

222
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,291
Keep her here.

223
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,375
Keep her alive.

224
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,458
As a hostage?

225
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,333
She's a witness.

226
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,958
She's the only one
we've got who can identify Axis.

227
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,041
- And Salman Paak?
- I don't care.

228
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,708
I'd like to hang him.

229
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,666
What's left of him anyway.

230
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,166
Make sure they know who's in charge.

231
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,291
As you wish.

232
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,708
The senator from Chandrila
stands with those in opposition

233
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,000
to the Emperor's new
public safety legislation.

234
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,363
Long live the Empire!

235
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,333
Is there a more important issue facing

236
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,625
this body right now
than Imperial overreach?

237
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:15,000
The Public Order Resentencing Directive
is the next step

238
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:19,750
on an all too predictable march
toward complete unchallenged authority.

239
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,125
She speaks the truth!

240
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,928
- Boo!
- Keep it down!

241
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,708
Our first responsibility
is to the citizens who have sent us here.

242
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,666
Our second vow is to protect the power

243
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,541
and independence
of this remarkable chamber.

244
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,750
Listen to her!

245
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:41,083
I stand here today to speak with
senators who've come with open minds,

246
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,083
those of you who still believe

247
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,166
that when we enter this building
we are in a temple.

248
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
<i>Drive.</i>

249
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,875
They called from the residence.

250
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,750
Your cousin, she's arrived.

251
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,541
<i>What?</i>

252
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,458
Your cousin.

253
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,166
<i>At the embassy?</i>

254
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,541
<i>She's there now?</i>

255
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,375
Well, they said you'd want to know.

256
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,267
- Where are they coming from?
- Don't know.

257
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,875
Keep it down!

258
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,965
They could keep us here forever
if they wanted.

259
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,434
That's enough from you, Melshi.

260
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,083
Right, everybody settles down right now.

261
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,916
Something's wrong.

262
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,750
Whatever it is,
they're taking their time about it.

263
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:35,833
What's going on?

264
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,750
What are they saying?

265
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:38,833
I think it's level two.

266
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,708
- All right.
- It gets stale in here.

267
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:50,892
Can't be much longer.

268
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:51,958
You all right, Ulaf?

269
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,041
I'm fine.

270
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,291
Level two, far side.

271
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,708
Taga, something broken?

272
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:57,791
What's he saying?

273
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,458
Level two.
He's coming this way around now.

274
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,250
- What's he saying?
- Quiet!

275
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,333
What's goin' on?

276
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,458
What was that?

277
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:12,708
What is that?

278
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,500
It's nothing. Someone didn't load in.

279
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,625
They are counting.

280
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,916
So they cut the power?

281
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,375
What do you think's happening?

282
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,916
Something's wrong on two.

283
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,291
- They're going too fast. I can't read it.
- Everybody, calm down!

284
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,750
Something's really wrong on two.

285
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,666
Look at me.

286
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,125
You haven't got a clue
what they are saying.

287
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,666
"Level two, far side. Level two."

288
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,541
Are you all scrambled or something?

289
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,291
It takes a week for one word
to get all the way up here.

290
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,083
And you're panicking about something

291
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,416
that's happening
on the other side of the building!

292
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,708
How many hands does it take
for one word to get through up here?

293
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,642
It's a long way, yes.
But you've got to admit...

294
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:53,976
<i>Stand in place.</i>

295
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,916
<i>On program. Feet down.
Face front. Hands on heads.</i>

296
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,125
<i>We will have immediate facility compliance</i>

297
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,458
<i>or we will begin activating
floors without warning.</i>

298
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,166
<i>Bridges on program
will have their doors opened.</i>

299
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,958
<i>All shifts to proceed
immediately to their stations.</i>

300
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,875
It's amazing.

301
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,166
Aunt Vel's been to Tassio Moon,
look what she brought me.

302
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,791
Your father may have an opinion.

303
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,416
We'll see if he lets you wear it.

304
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,000
He lets me do anything I want.

305
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,791
Well, why don't you go try it on?

306
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:40,833
Where have you been?

307
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,458
- Traveling.
- Six months?

308
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,666
There's a lot to see.

309
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,958
I don't have enough to worry about.

310
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,458
Look at you.

311
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,083
The Empire doesn't rest, Mon.

312
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,708
The Rebellion comes first.

313
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,750
We take what's left.

314
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,666
Tell me you're going home for a visit.

315
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,375
They've been after me to find you.

316
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,541
Of course.

317
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,250
Just came through to see you first
and get cleaned up a bit.

318
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,958
Seriously, Vel,
what does he have you doing?

319
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,291
Who?

320
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,625
You're one to worry about.

321
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,291
Trapped here, boxed in.

322
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,458
- Please tell me you're being careful.
- Things are happening.

323
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,583
There's risk.

324
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,333
There's no other way.

325
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,666
I'm starting to think
we're in over our heads.

326
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,166
- He's got us spinning...
- Stop.

327
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,333
You took a vow.

328
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,583
It fits.

329
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,000
You never think about escaping?

330
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,625
You know I won't answer that.

331
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,708
I'll take that as a no.

332
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,708
Take what you like.

333
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,833
You flap that mouth of yours any longer,
you'll regret it.

334
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,125
I'm sure you've thought about it.

335
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,750
How many guards on each level?

336
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:06,541
You want out of here alive,
turn that part of your mind off.

337
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:08,958
Okay.

338
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,541
How many shifts you have left?

339
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,875
217.

340
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:22,500
So, tell me what you know before you go.

341
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,791
You've been warned.

342
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,708
You think they care what we say?

343
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,025
You're on your own with this.

344
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,125
Why?

345
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,541
You think they're listening?

346
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,375
You think they care enough
to make an effort?

347
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,791
Like you would know.

348
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,708
I know this.

349
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,083
They don't need to care.

350
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,125
All they need to do
is turn this floor on twice a day

351
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,875
and keep their numbers rolling.

352
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,541
Why bother listening to us?

353
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,125
We are nothing to them.

354
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,416
Melshi's right.

355
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,166
We're cheaper than droids
and easier to replace.

356
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,791
Good luck to you.

357
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,791
You think they care what we say?

358
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,041
Nobody's listening.

359
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,291
Nobody.

360
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,583
How many guards are on each level?

361
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,578
Nobody's listening.

362
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,416
Nobody's listening!

363
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,541
You took Gorst.

364
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,375
Good to see that's working out.

365
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,309
Yes, sir.
The interrogation was thorough.

366
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,625
We've no reason to believe
anything was withheld.

367
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,125
But no ID on your Axis.

368
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,708
He's still just 'The Buyer'?

369
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,000
It's disappointing, I know.

370
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,958
But it does suggest
the scope of what he's doing.

371
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,583
Axis obviously runs
a very disciplined operation.

372
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:46,166
And one that's large enough to not be
reliant on any one network or supplier.

373
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,583
Caleen gave us a list of every piece
of gear that came through Ferrix.

374
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,708
And we think we've already got a match

375
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,166
to a targeting unit recovered
from a safe house

376
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,333
operated by a rebel cell
associated with Maya Pei.

377
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,625
Andor, he's all the way through this.

378
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,541
Yes, and that's what
I'd like to highlight.

379
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:03,875
He's the local thief, right?
The runaway murderer?

380
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:07,916
Andor returned to Ferrix three nights
after Aldhani with money in his pocket.

381
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,041
Couldn't that be
from the sale of the Starpath?

382
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,000
Can't be. They left it behind, right?

383
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:13,791
You're trying to connect Aldhani?

384
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,250
That's a bit of a stretch.

385
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:16,958
He was clean-shaven.

386
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,083
Andor had shaved.

387
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,791
Question, "Describe his appearance."

388
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,166
Answer, "He'd shaved his beard."

389
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,000
The rebels at Aldhani were clean-shaven.

390
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,916
Two soldiers from the garrison
who got a look at him

391
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,916
felt some similarity
to our reference picture.

392
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,041
Well, that's worth running down.

393
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,625
An Aldhani connection
would certainly amplify interest.

394
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,375
Let's follow that up.

395
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,041
You didn't question the mother?

396
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,125
I decided to wait.

397
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,333
Better now leaving her in place
and standing back.

398
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,416
She's too old and frail
for anything serious,

399
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,625
and if nothing else, she's our bait.

400
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,666
She's the reason Andor came back.

401
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,000
Perhaps they communicate.

402
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,791
If they are, we'll know.

403
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,416
We're on her full-time.

404
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:14,791
Did you hear it?

405
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,208
- Have you heard?
- What?

406
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,767
What happened to unit two-five.

407
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,750
- We weren't told anything.
- You're kidding.

408
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,083
They don't know about it.

409
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,208
They were fried out!

410
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:24,750
- They're killed. They're all gone.
- Who said?

411
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,541
- Both shifts.
- A hundred men.

412
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:27,665
That can't be right.

413
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,041
You've heard nothing.

414
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,125
What did he say?

415
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,875
- I don't know.
- They're all dead.

416
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,083
Who's saying this?

417
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,083
- Maintenance tech.
- We had a team go down.

418
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,486
- They said they fried the whole bridge.
- Speak up.

419
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:38,833
He told Zinska.

420
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:40,250
Why?

421
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,083
Ask him.

422
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,666
That's incredible.

423
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:49,666
Zinska?

424
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,541
He heard they were making trouble.

425
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,458
<i>On program. Feet down.</i>

426
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:59,291
<i>We will have immediate facility compliance
or we will begin...</i>

427
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,750
What did he say?

428
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,041
What happened on two?

429
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,833
We... We don't know.

430
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,208
They set 'em all free.

431
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,875
- Get on program!
- Kino! Kino!

432
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,041
We need to be careful.

433
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:14,166
The less they think we know, the better.

434
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:21,375
Hold your program!

435
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:24,416
Tighten up and listen!

436
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:27,833
It's a rumor.

437
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,583
Maybe it's true.

438
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:33,333
Maybe it's not.

439
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:36,166
We have heard nothing.

440
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:43,375
It's just another day, another shift.

441
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,833
So let's keep our mouths shut,

442
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:50,916
keep our heads down
until we know what's going on.

443
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:07,041
You're up early.

444
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,916
Home late, up early.

445
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,750
Dressed and groomed.

446
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,416
Trimmed your hair.

447
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:14,375
Hmm. Something I should know?

448
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:17,000
I told you not to leave
dinner out last night.

449
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,125
Your message was so brief.

450
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:20,541
One worries.

451
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,541
You're so busy these days,
perhaps you're forgetting to eat.

452
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,500
You've been searching my room again.

453
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,500
It's called cleaning.

454
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:28,833
I like a tidy house.

455
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,416
You've been in my private box.

456
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:33,333
I have ways of knowing.

457
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:43,916
I find you a job, I press your uniform,
I prepare two meals a day,

458
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,125
I move mountains
to scrape you off the floor

459
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:49,166
and put you back on your feet,
and what do I reap?

460
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,250
What is the return on my investment?

461
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:54,208
We were talking about you snooping on me.

462
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:57,875
The shadow of a son, a tenant, a stranger.

463
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,625
That's new. You'll wanna remember that.

464
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:01,833
All that time away on Morlana.

465
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:04,250
What if I'd let your neglect
drive me insane?

466
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,708
Imagine that.

467
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,750
Look back just months ago
when you could easily ignore me.

468
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:11,875
Imagine.

469
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:15,125
Imagine I'd cracked
under the weight of your neglect.

470
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:19,000
Imagine I'd cracked
and wasn't here now to pick up the pieces.

471
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,875
I've been promoted.

472
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,250
I knew they'd recognize your promise.

473
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:36,833
The demands of my time will be increased.

474
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:39,083
Uncle Harlo will be so pleased.

475
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:52,023
- Drill in.
- Right.

476
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:55,375
Ulaf, come on, mate.

477
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,583
Pull away.

478
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,416
- Come on, boys. Let's go.
- One, two.

479
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,601
- Let's go.
- I'm there. I'm there. I got it.

480
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:12,338
That's it. That's it.

481
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,833
- All right.
- Okay, let's go.

482
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,166
Come on, Ulaf.

483
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,291
Hands away.

484
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,458
- Clear.
- Ulaf, hands.

485
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:24,750
Turn.

486
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,833
Come on, boys. We can do this.

487
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,625
I'll do it. Just... Just get it in.

488
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:37,583
Come on, boys.

489
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:40,875
Just the one night, Vel?

490
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:41,958
I'm afraid so.

491
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:43,708
Heading back to Chandrila today?

492
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:45,625
Yes. The Pilgrimage.

493
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,750
Find yourself a husband?

494
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:50,333
Wasn't on my list of things to do.

495
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:53,208
Well, you need a widower at this point.

496
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:55,375
Who's left of any value at your age?

497
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:57,875
Yes. All the good ones are taken.

498
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:01,666
We've had an influx
of Chandrilans here recently.

499
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,916
- You remember Tay Kolma?
- I do.

500
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,291
Mother's old boyfriend.

501
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:07,375
What?

502
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:09,250
Is that something you've told her?

503
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,000
The key word is "old," darling.

504
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,750
We were in grade school together.

505
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:15,166
At least you've not gone political, Vel.

506
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,125
All the interesting people
are getting very tedious these days.

507
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,875
No one ever calls me tedious.

508
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,458
<i>Tay Kolma?</i>

509
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,458
Money.

510
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:25,541
Is that all it is?

511
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,833
I don't have enough to worry about?

512
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:30,083
Anything I can do?

513
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:31,208
Yes.

514
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:34,791
Be a spoiled, rich girl for a while.

515
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,583
Remind people that's who you are.

516
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:38,666
I'll try.

517
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,958
What have we done, Vel?

518
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,916
We've chosen a side.

519
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,833
We're fighting against the dark.

520
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:50,208
We're making something of our lives.

521
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:11,083
- Syril Karn.
- I know who you are.

522
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:15,166
- What are you doing here?
- I...

523
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,000
I wanted to thank you for the promotion.

524
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,333
I had nothing to do with it.

525
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:22,541
Well, my boss seems
to think that you did.

526
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,958
We simply gave you a clean bill of health.

527
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:27,958
Have you been waiting out here?

528
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:29,083
Yes.

529
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,583
I'd never lie to you.

530
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:33,958
I...

531
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,541
I needed to find you
and it's not that easy

532
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:39,083
to thank you for what you did
and what you're doing.

533
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,208
And to follow on and...

534
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,583
Try to follow on the conversation
we had last month.

535
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:47,625
That wasn't a conversation.
You were brought in for questioning.

536
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:49,416
Are you stalking me?

537
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:53,500
I know you work here and I come
sometimes to see if I'll see you.

538
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:56,291
I am an ISB supervisor.

539
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:59,500
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in right now?

540
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,333
I thought I had ruined my life.

541
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,208
I thought I was done.

542
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,333
After meeting you and discovering,

543
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:10,041
you understood how dangerous
Cassian Andor was. Just...

544
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:15,916
Just being in your presence, I...
I've realized that life is worth living.

545
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,291
I realized that if nothing else,
there was justice,

546
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,875
and beauty in the galaxy
and if I just kept going...

547
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:25,541
Perhaps my deranged belief that there
was something better fated for me

548
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:28,625
in the future was a dream
worth clinging to.

549
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,708
I could have you arrested,
you are aware of that?

550
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:34,000
I want what you want.

551
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:37,208
I sense it. I know it.

552
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:39,041
You're out of your mind.

553
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,041
I have already given you a second chance.

554
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,916
You come near me again,
you pursue any of this,

555
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,166
and I swear
I'll have you in a cage on the Outer Rim.

556
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:04,791
There you are. Just came in.
They picked up a rebel pilot an hour ago.

557
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:06,541
- From our target list?
- No, random.

558
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:08,958
But he's using
a stolen Imperial masking unit.

559
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:11,125
- One of ours?
- Well, Corv is checking but...

560
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:14,041
- Where are they holding him?
- A destroyer off Steergaard.

561
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,125
Get Dr. Gorst,
send him out there immediately.

562
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,250
I already did.

563
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,791
He's own his way.

564
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:21,125
- Do you want to go?
- Yes. No. There's no time.

565
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,208
I'll interrogate remotely.

566
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:24,458
Good work.

567
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:25,583
Go.

568
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:35,500
I've been over the accounts.

569
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,916
I wish you'd called me sooner.

570
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:41,541
There were better ways to do this.

571
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:44,250
It was so easy at the beginning.

572
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:47,166
If we plan
on making any further donations,

573
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,416
we need to be sure
that the work you've done so far

574
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,500
- isn't gonna come back to haunt you.
- They can't all be hidden?

575
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:55,875
There's a 400,000 credit withdrawal
that's proving a bit of a problem.

576
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:57,708
It appears on the ledger,
then it vanishes.

577
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,916
- It needs to be papered over.
- How?

578
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,083
Easiest thing would be a deposit.

579
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,958
If I had that much sitting around,
I wouldn't have burdened you.

580
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:09,125
How much trouble am I in?

581
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,958
There's no trouble at all
unless they scan the accounts.

582
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:13,333
But that's coming.

583
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,791
Time is not unlimited.

584
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,291
I need a loan.

585
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:23,666
A certain kind of loan.

586
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,500
You seem to have thought this through.

587
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:32,541
We need a Chandrilan banker
with treasury relationships,

588
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:36,500
and a book of business
that's incomprehensibly huge.

589
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:39,375
You have someone in mind.

590
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:40,458
It's not a long list.

591
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:43,541
- And yet you're afraid to say who it is.
- Davo Sculdun.

592
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:47,958
He is not a banker.

593
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:50,791
- He's a thug.
- The wealthiest thug of them all.

594
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,517
Don't tell me
you've spoken to him already.

595
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:54,517
- I wanted to bring you a solution.
- Have you told him?

596
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:56,559
That you're feeling constricted
by the new tax laws.

597
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:58,916
- It's common enough.
- A senator, 400,000 missing.

598
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
What will he think?

599
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,226
He'll think you're just like
everyone else he works with.

600
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,750
You want what's yours.

601
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:04,958
At what cost?

602
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:06,208
I'm not sure.

603
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:08,250
He wants to meet you.

604
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,583
He wants to meet here.

605
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:16,708
Davo Sculdun, here. You must be joking.

606
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,125
I pushed back but...

607
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,583
I could keep looking.

608
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:36,416
It was a routine customs check.

609
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,309
- Totally random.
- Just the pilot?

610
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:40,625
- He was the only one on board.
- And no witnesses.

611
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:41,851
The beauty of it, sir.

612
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:44,416
He flashed an Imperial profile
for a moment then vanished.

613
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,041
They thought it was odd and pursued.

614
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,934
Any chance he radioed home
before they got him?

615
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:49,875
He swears he didn't.
He thought he'd get away.

616
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,833
This was a Dr. Gorst interview?

617
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,333
Yes, sir. Confidence is high.

618
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:55,291
He got the pilot
talking almost immediately.

619
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:58,095
The Imperial masking device
he used is one of the items stolen

620
00:35:58,166 --> 00:36:00,642
- from the naval yard in Lozash last year.
- Incredible.

621
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,125
Apologies. We were offsite.

622
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:03,750
We've got a rebel pilot in custody.

623
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,208
One of Anto Kreegyr's group.

624
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:07,000
He was picked up at a customs check.

625
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,291
We don't think Kreegyr knows
he's gone missing yet.

626
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,833
He's telling us there's a raid planned
on the power station at Spellhaus.

627
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:13,958
Where was he heading?

628
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:16,416
- On his way to Kafrene.
- They'll count him missing soon.

629
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,583
Exactly. We don't want
Kreegyr getting spooked.

630
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:20,392
We can't hang on to him.
We can't let him go.

631
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:22,267
Destroy the ship.
Make it look like an accident.

632
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:24,642
There's too much at stake.
If I were Kreegyr, I'd be suspicious.

633
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,306
We want Kreegyr moving forward.

634
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:27,666
What if we foul the ship?

635
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,416
An accident. Something mechanical.

636
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,083
Have the pilot found dead in the cockpit.
What would happen?

637
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:35,041
They'd have to find it.
But they'd tow it into Kafrene.

638
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:38,583
If we did it quickly, staged it properly,
let it drift into traffic.

639
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:41,791
Make it so. Top priority.
Quickly and carefully.

640
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:43,250
We leave no trace.

641
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,500
Excellent work.

642
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:48,583
I want a meeting with military
intelligence immediately about Spellhaus.

643
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,541
Let's go.

644
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,226
<i>Inmates, on program.</i>

645
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,541
<i>Program in place.</i>

646
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,666
<i>Low yield tables in position.</i>

647
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,958
Table two takes the shift
by six racks and three.

648
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,041
Table one in the box.

649
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,791
- Ulaf.
- Come on. Let's get this done.

650
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,538
- Can he stand?
- Yeah.

651
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,250
<i>On program.</i>

652
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,291
Cover him. Cover him. Cover him.

653
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:00,625
- Hang on.
<i>- Inmates on program.</i>

654
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:01,916
<i>Program in place.</i>

655
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,083
<i>Low yield tables in position.</i>

656
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:11,416
Ulaf. Hey, look at me.

657
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,041
Okay.

658
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,500
Almost there. Almost there.

659
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:42,625
Kino, he needs a doctor.

660
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:43,833
Get him to the cell.

661
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:50,208
We're late. Come on. Keep moving.

662
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:51,708
Keep moving. Keep moving.

663
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:54,041
One, two, three.

664
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,166
All right. All right.

665
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,208
- Take his head.
- I got you.

666
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:00,666
Zinska, tell 'em we need
a med tech-up here.

667
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:05,000
You, get going. Now.

668
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:11,000
Hang in there, Ulaf.

669
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:13,500
You've only got a few shifts left.

670
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:14,916
Then you're going home.

671
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,708
<i>On program.</i>

672
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,166
Step off. Let's go.

673
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,250
Here he comes, Uli.

674
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,541
He'll have you back in your cell
soon enough.

675
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,500
Haven't seen you for a while.

676
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:52,916
I haven't gone anywhere.

677
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:58,041
His name's Ulaf.

678
00:39:58,125 --> 00:39:59,416
I've seen him before.

679
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
Hold that.

680
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,333
He's only got 40 shifts left.

681
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:11,500
Just wanna get him up and about.

682
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,416
He's tough as an old rock.

683
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,875
Look at me, brother.

684
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:20,958
His name is Ulaf.

685
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:22,541
I don't wanna know his name.

686
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:26,083
He's got 40 shifts left.

687
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:29,583
So we just want something
to get him through the next few days.

688
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:31,041
Get him back on his feet.

689
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:32,458
That's not an option.

690
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,041
What?

691
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:36,833
What, you can't save him?

692
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:38,541
There's nothing to save.

693
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,125
He's had a massive stroke.

694
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:49,083
What are you doing?

695
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:51,625
I can't help him.

696
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:53,791
I can't help anyone.

697
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,791
I need a bag and a trolley.

698
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:57,875
It's coming.

699
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,041
He's lucky.

700
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,958
He'll pass peacefully, which is more
than I can say for the rest of us.

701
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:11,166
Another week like this, and you'll
be begging for what he's getting.

702
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:13,041
What do you mean?

703
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:14,958
You heard me.

704
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:17,750
Hold his shoulders. You, hold his legs.

705
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:21,791
What happened on level two?

706
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:26,208
You'll want to keep your men in line.

707
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:28,333
Now hold him.

708
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:33,000
He'll feel nothing.

709
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:48,291
He's passed.

710
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:56,000
What do you mean...
keep my men in line?

711
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,041
What happened down on two?

712
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:02,291
We need a bag and a trolley.

713
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:03,541
I said it's coming.

714
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,541
They made a mistake.

715
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:16,375
A man who was just released on four
ended up back on two the next day.

716
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:19,250
Word got out on the floor,
and then they killed them all.

717
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:20,853
You need those other men there?

718
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,618
They're just leaving.

719
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:23,666
Now.

720
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,375
If he was released...

721
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
You heard me.

722
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:31,750
No one's getting out, are they?

723
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:34,208
Not now.

724
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:35,458
Not after this.

725
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:38,541
At least your friend is free.

726
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,666
You two, on program now.

727
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:42,666
Up. Hands on your heads.

728
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,750
Move.

729
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:47,000
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

730
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,125
Now. Let's go.

731
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,583
How many guards are on each level?

732
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,416
Never more than 12.
