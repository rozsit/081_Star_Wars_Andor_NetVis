1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:05,291
So, searching for a more fluid
banking situation, are we?

2
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:06,624
What will it cost?

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:07,999
I have a 14-year-old son.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,249
I'd like to bring him with me.

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,416
- I'm not asking for betrothal.
- Then what are we talking about?

6
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:13,499
[Davo] <i>An introduction.</i>

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,249
<i>Your daughter is 13.
She'll soon come of age.</i>

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,457
<i>Two young people.</i>

9
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,041
<i>Attractive and privileged
Chandrilan citizens.</i>

10
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:23,374
What makes you think I
approve of that tradition?

11
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:27,917
<i>Our position sometimes makes
decisions for us, don't you find?</i>

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,874
[Krole] <i>I'm only here for
another couple of days.</i>

13
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,624
<i>Maybe you'd like to join me.</i>

14
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,708
I'm not sure my
husband would approve.

15
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:37,958
Is he here?

16
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,874
[Gerdis] You can
stop right there!

17
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,249
You got 15 blasters
pointed at you right now!

18

[grunting]

19
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:48,417
[Krole] <i>Does he worry about you?</i>

20
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:50,707
In what way?

21
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,916
[Krole] We've just shut
down all the comms.

22
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:55,082
We freeze the zone
during an audit.

23
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,917
It's supposed to stop things sneaking
away while we're doing all our counting.

24
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:00,582
[Kleya] <i>Nothing.</i>

25
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,875
Radio silence.
Nobody's checked in.

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,041
I need to be at the gallery.

27
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:08,125
I can't help anyone from
here. I need serious comms.

28
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,124
[Dedra] Is that everything?

29
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,291
I was sure if I went
shopping, you'd be delayed,

30
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:14,792
and we wouldn't have to do this.

31
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,625
No such luck.

32
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:20,749
We could... pretend
that you're not back.

33
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,833
I have concerns. The
Foundation is up and running.

34
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,707
Your financial blemishes
have been smoothed over

35
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:29,082
without anyone being the wiser.

36
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,250
Davo Sculdun obviously
has what he came for.

37
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,082
Everyone seems quite pleased
with how they've landed,

38
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,707
<i>and I'm left wondering about
the risk I've taken on.</i>

39
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:38,832
[Luthen] <i>It's very troubling.</i>

40
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,416
We'll find a number.

41
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:42,249
Is there any chance
he'd go to Sculdun?

42
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,417
No, he wouldn't dare.

43
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,833
He can't.

44
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,541

He's out! He's getting away!

Come on!

50
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,125
Bring it down!

[Brasso] Yeah. Pay

And, uh, who's helping me bring all
that's left back up the mound tonight?

Oh, I think we have a volunteer.

Be back in a minute. Keep an

80
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:44,875
[farmer 3] No guarantee.

81
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,541
Sorry, I tried to get
here earlier, but...

82
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:54,958
[sighs] You've got
a lot going on.

83
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:56,750
Still no Cassian?

84
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,667
I got the call from Six
Hundred this morning.

85
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,625
I wish I had better news.

86
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,750
We're next on the
inspection schedule.

87
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,332
How soon?

88
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,667
They finished there today, so...

89
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:11,792
tomorrow?

90
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,707
- Are they checking visas?
- It's random.

91
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,375
They found a group hiding
last night in Six Hundred.

92
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,291
Sometimes, they walk right by.

93
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,416
It's a big risk.

94
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:22,750
Where can we go?

95
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,792
This is the best I could do.

96
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,208
It's an Emergency Work Order
for the Eight Hundred Block.

97
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,499
Three sweepers that need fixing.

98
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,832
You head out tonight, wait till
they finish poking around here,

99
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,582
then circle back
'round in a few days.

100
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,708
Is it legit?

101
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,291
I had to change the date.

102
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:42,958
You only use it tonight
if you got stopped.

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,333
Sorry about this, Kellen.

104
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,625
- You've been a savior.
- Please.

105
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:49,874
You know Cassian's friend?

106
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,125
The big boss?

107
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,207
If you do and don't want
to say so, that's fine.

108
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,042
But someone needs to tell
him what's going on here.

109
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,541
It's going on everywhere.

[sighs]

111
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,958

leave us in peace?

My gown got snagged.

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,332
Oh, no. Is it all right?

119
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,874
I think I stopped in time.

120
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,000
It's fine.

121
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,042
Really is.

122

Are you nervous?

123
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,375
Of course I'm nervous.

124
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,083
I was awake all night
worrying about you.

125
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:10,000
Are they all out there?

126
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,583
They can wait.

127
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,375
My mother was drunk when
I got married. [chuckles]

129

Right here. [chuckles]

130
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:29,792
Just like this.

131
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:33,167
I was so angry, I don't
think I ever forgave her.

132
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,583
But I could never understand why
she'd done it until just now.

133
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:40,625
What are you doing?

134
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,374
I need to tell you

135
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,999
- what my mother never told me.
- [woman laughs]

136

Look at me.

137

Nothing on the other side
of that door matters.

Not the guests, not the gifts, not
the... trouble that's gone into it,

139
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,208
none of it matters.

We can walk out there right now,

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,917
tell them all to have
a lovely afternoon,

144
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,000
but that it's not yet
time for a marriage.

145
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,917
We can put it off.
[breath trembling]

And it will be remembered
as an act of great bravery,

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,500
I promise you.

You do not have to
go through with this.

Yes, absolutely.

Now, Syril's father fancied
himself an adventurer.

For those of you who are visiting

It's a temple figure, one of 12

when Chandrila was sacked
by Rakatan invaders.

343
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:27,583
Until today, there were only
eight of these accounted for.

And only five that had
made their way back home.

Well, my father's Chandrilan.
I was born in Naboo.

- My mother's Ghorman.
- Oh.

00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:38,250
He was married.
It was a scandal.
